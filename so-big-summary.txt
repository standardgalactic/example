In *So Big* (1953), a cinematic exploration that feels as endless as the fields its protagonist tills, Selina Peake DeJong transforms from a bright-eyed urbanite into a dirt-smeared agrarian, exchanging the glittering lights of the city for the relentless glare of the sun over endless farmland. Selina, portrayed with a martyr-like resilience, takes to the soil like a reverse-moth to a flame — drawn not to the destruction of light but to the punishing redemption of the earth.

The plot plows forward with the grim inevitability of seasonal change. After the death of her gambler father, who instilled in her a love for stories rather than any practical skills, Selina finds herself abruptly ejected from her genteel urban life into the rural rough. She marries Pervus DeJong, a man as exciting as his name suggests, purely as a strategic career move in her unexpected new role as a farmer’s wife.

Selina’s transformation is underscored by a cascade of hardships that would inspire either profound respect or a drinking game — one shot for every sermon on the virtues of hard work and self-sacrifice. Her dedication to the land and to her son Dirk, whom she pushes towards the artistic success she abandoned, is portrayed as a noble if Sisyphean task. Dirk, however, grows up with all the gratitude and artistic integrity of a damp sponge, opting for a more lucrative career in architecture over the garret-bound existence of a true artist, much to Selina’s despair.

The film relentlessly reinforces the notion that true value can only be cultivated through suffering and sacrifice, a moral fertilizer that seems to grow nothing but corny platitudes and existential ennui. As Selina ages in time-lapse, becoming part of the scenery herself, viewers are left to ponder the harsh economics of farming — both in soil and in soul.

Technically, the film is a master class in making the most of a limited budget, squeezing every ounce of pathos from its settings and costumes, which fluctuate between 'Depression-chic' and 'Midwestern-dreary.' The cinematography is as straightforward as the plot, with shots lingering on the landscape and Selina’s increasingly furrowed brow as if trying to harvest some deeper meaning from the visual monotony.

In conclusion, *So Big* is an ode to the agricultural grind and maternal guilt, wrapped up in a narrative as predictable as crop rotation. Its earnestness is both its most endearing quality and its most tiresome, serving up a slice of Americana that’s as subtly flavored as a loaf of plain white bread. If the film were a crop, it would be soybeans: ostensibly versatile and nutritious, but fundamentally unexciting.
