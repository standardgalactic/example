This approach reflects a belief in the potential for science to provide comprehensive explanations for what once seemed beyond comprehension.

The passage discusses the importance of evaluating claims based on the reasoning process behind them, rather than just their content. It emphasizes that for a claim to be rational, it must be causally linked to reality through an evidence-based reasoning process. This means that the conclusions should not merely reflect predetermined beliefs or desires but should be influenced by actual data and observations from the real world.

The author suggests examining whether someone's argumentation is genuinely driven by evidence and how well their reasoning can adapt to different realities, potentially leading them to various conclusions depending on new information. The key distinction made is between being truly rational—where conclusions are derived logically and evidentially—and merely producing a "rationalization," where the outcome reflects personal biases or intentions without proper engagement with reality.

In essence, rational claims should arise from an algorithmic process that allows the content to change based on real-world inputs. Claims that fail this test might simply be rationalizations designed to convince others without substantive grounding in evidence. Thus, evaluating the causal connection between reality and a person's written conclusions is crucial for determining their rationality.
