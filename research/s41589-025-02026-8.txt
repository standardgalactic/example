Endogenous uridine-rich small nuclear RNAs (U snRNAs) form RNA-protein 
complexes to process eukaryotic pre-mRNA into mRNA. Previous studies 
have demonstrated programmable U snRNA guide-targeted exon inclusion 
and exclusion. Here we investigated whether snRNAs can also enhance RNA 
base editing over state-of-the-art RNA-targeting technologies in human 
cells. Compared with adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR)-recruiting 
circular RNAs, we find that guided A>I snRNAs consistently increase 
adenosine-to-inosine editing for higher exon count genes, perturb 
substantially fewer off-target genes and localize more persistently to the 
nucleus where ADAR is expressed. A>I snRNAs also more efficiently edit long 
noncoding RNAs and pre-mRNA 3′ splice sites to promote splicing changes. 
Lastly, snRNA-H/ACA box snoRNA fusions (U>Ψ snRNAs) increase targeted 
RNA pseudouridylation without DKC1 overexpression, facilitating improved 
CFTR rescue from nonsense-mediated mRNA decay in a cystic fibrosis 
human bronchial epithelial cell model. Our results advance the endogenous 
protein-mediated RNA base editing toolbox and RNA-targeting technologies 
to treat genetic diseases.
Recently the gene-editing field has turned from CRISPR (clustered 
regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) and other exog-
enous protein-encoded multicomponent systems toward minimally 
invasive single-component guided RNA scaffolds that recruit highly 
expressed endogenous protein machinery to edit genes at the RNA 
level1. Researchers have particularly focused on suppressing in-frame 
premature termination codons (PTCs) caused by single-base-pair sub-
stitution nonsense mutations in coding regions of mRNA transcripts. 
PTCs, which account for an estimated 10-15% of human genetic diseases 
such as cystic fibrosis and Hurler syndrome, lead to truncated proteins 
and subsequent degradation of PTC-harboring mRNAs by nonsense-
mediated mRNA decay (NMD)2.
Given a clearly defined mechanism, several minimally invasive 
strategies already exist to treat PTC-associated diseases. More clinically 
established drugs such as splice-switching antisense oligonucleotides 
and small molecules could be administered to patients3-5, but not all 
PTC diseases are amenable to exon skipping and PTC suppressor small 
molecules lack target-site specificity. Similarly, engineered suppressor 
tRNAs designed to read through PTCs at the translational level could do 
so at any targeted stop codon context sequence6,7. In contrast to these 
approaches, programmable guided RNA scaffolds that recruit highly 
expressed endogenous proteins to edit PTC bases directly strike a safer 
balance between minimal invasiveness and specificity.
One such class of systems recruits endogenous adenosine  
deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) enzymes to edit PTC adenosines 
to inosines. In mammalian cells, active ADAR family members ADAR1  
and ADAR2 recognize regions of nuclear double-stranded RNA,  
primarily at Alu repetitive regions but also in coding regions and even

PTC sequence contexts (UAG, UGA and UAA), leading to successful 
translational readthrough16,17. While a promising approach, snoRNAs 
localize predominantly to the nucleolus and not to the nucleoplasm 
where pre-mRNAs are transcribed and processed into mRNAs, thus 
limiting their base editing potential.
Although the gene-editing field has evolved beyond CRISPR, 
important lessons endure from CRISPR's success. For example, a 
peptide nuclear localization signal was critical for translation of 
Cas9 activity from prokaryotic to eukaryotic cells18,19. Analogously, 
we hypothesized that achieving optimal subcellular localization 
of programmable guided RNA scaffolds could enhance the ability  
of endogenous protein machinery to perform base editing on tar-
get coding RNA transcripts. To test this hypothesis, we selected as a 
putative RNA nucleoplasm localization signal components of endo­
genous uridine-rich snRNAs (U snRNAs), which natively recruit pro-
tein complexes to process pre-mRNA into mature mRNA and were  
previously engineered to modulate RNA splicing20,21. In this new appli-
cation, we evaluated the capacity of U snRNAs to enhance endogenous 
protein-mediated base editing, both A>I and U>Ψ, on mammalian 
transcripts.
at splice sites8. After A>I editing, splicing and translation machin-
ery generally recognizes inosine as its structurally comparable  
base, guanosine. Leveraging this finding, several groups have encoded 
a cytosine-mismatch (C-mismatch) guided RNA scaffold of both  
linear and circular form, which, when hybridized to the RNA sequence 
surrounding a targeted adenosine, recruits endogenous ADARs that 
efficiently edit the targeted adenosine opposite the cytosine to 
inosine9-11. While robust editing is possible, ADARs display a strong 
preference for the UAG motif, with diminished activity for the other 
PTC sequence contexts of UGA and UAA, in addition to varying by cell 
type expression12.
Another class of systems uses H/ACA box small nucleolar ribo­
nucleoproteins (snoRNPs), which are highly conserved across eukary-
otes and catalyze uridine-to-pseudouridine (U>Ψ) editing on small 
nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and some mRNAs13,14. 
In mammalian cells, H/ACA box snoRNAs recruit four core proteins, 
DKC1, NOP10, NHP2 and GAR1. Together, these proteins edit U>Ψ at a 
site between two guide-templated regions specified by the H/ACA box 
snoRNA. Building upon initial work performed in yeast15, two groups 
reprogrammed human H/ACA box snoRNAs to edit U>Ψ at all three

Results
Preclinical studies using engineered U1 and U7smOPT snRNAs have 
already shown promise for the inclusion and exclusion of exons in 
disease rescue20,21. In fact, an AAV9-mediated U7smOPT snRNA gene 
therapy to treat boys with DMD exon 2 duplications is currently in phase 
1/2 clinical trials (NCT04240314). On the basis of this established track 
record and the fact that most other U snRNAs are recruited downstream 
of U1, we concentrated on these two U snRNAs. U1 snRNAs (bound  
by highly expressed U1A, U1-70K, U1C and members of the Sm core)  
initiate the major spliceosome to splice introns out of pre-mRNA.  
Meanwhile, U7 snRNAs initiate the 3′ end processing of nonpoly-
adenylated histone pre-mRNAs. Researchers previously mutated U7 
snRNAs into U7smOPT snRNAs that bind only the Sm core, a key com-
ponent of the majority of splicing U snRNAs, and not LSm proteins. 
With backbone sizes of 153 and 45 nt respectively, U1 and U7smOPT 
snRNAs are comparatively small and easily encodable in a variety  
of genetic delivery vehicles, from lipid nanoparticles to adeno- 
associated virus.
A>I editing with engineered U snRNAs
Of the existing single-component A>I programmable guided RNA 
scaffolds, circularized ADAR-recruiting RNAs (cadRNAs) have dem-
onstrated potent editing using a simple design10,11. With their elegant 
circularization by autoligating twister ribozymes, cadRNAs effectively 
withstand degradation by exoribonucleases to sustain strong expres-
sion in cells. cadRNAs contain a C-mismatch guide with typically 100-nt 
homology regions flanking either side of the mismatched C and occa-
sionally mismatches and loops throughout these flanking regions to 
inhibit spurious bystander editing by ADAR. Because of their shared 
nuclear localization with ADAR, U snRNAs may be more efficient A>I 
editors than cadRNAs. Moreover, spliceosomal component Sm proteins 
have been found to associate with ADAR1 and ADAR2 (ref. 22). To test 
this conjecture, we replaced the cadRNA backbone (in a U6 promoter 
and U6 terminator cassette) with either the U7smOPT snRNA backbone 
(in a U7 promoter and U7 terminator cassette) or U1 snRNA backbone 
(in a U1 promoter and U1 terminator cassette) at the 3′ end of fixed 
C-mismatch guides (Fig. 1a).

A head-to-head A>I editing test of the two U snRNAs against 
cadRNA across seven previously published endogenous loci and associ-
ated C-mismatch guide sequences in HEK293T cells revealed several 
findings (Fig. 1b)10. Firstly, U1 snRNA almost invariably performed more 
poorly than U7smOPT snRNA. We reasoned that its greater molecular 
complexity and proclivity for splicing machinery recruitment caused 
this limiting effect; thus, we disregarded U1 snRNA as a construct for 
the remainder of our study. Secondly, although U7smOPT snRNA 
bested cadRNA across four of the seven loci, neither initially appeared 
a clear winner. Lastly, U7smOPT snRNA most unambiguously out-
shone cadRNA editing performance at loci on SMAD4 and FANCC, 
genes with the highest exon counts. We, therefore, hypothesized that 
the relative A>I editing performance of U7smOPT snRNA compared 
to cadRNA across target genes correlates positively with gene exon 
count. To test this theory further, we compared U7smOPT snRNA 
and cadRNA performance on eight new loci of genes with progres-
sively higher exon counts (Fig. 1c). On all target genes except BLM, 
U7smOPT snRNA convincingly outperformed cadRNA across high 
exon count gene loci. Lending more credence to our theory, the ratio 
of U7smOPT snRNA-to-cadRNA editing efficiency over the 15 tested 
genes correlated moderately and statistically significantly with exon 
count (Pearson correlation coefficient r = 0.6282, P = 0.0121) in contrast 
with unsupported alternative hypotheses of gene length (r = −0.0414, 
P = 0.8836) or mRNA nuclear export rate as reported in a recent study 
(r = 0.1436, P = 0.6096) (Extended Data Fig. 1)23. Given that genes with 
high exon count tend to be larger and more prone to accumulating 
disease-relevant mutations (as is the case for DMD, in which ~15% of 
Duchenne muscular dystrophy-implicated mutations are nonsense)24, 
U7smOPT snRNAs present an attractive new modality for treating PTC 
diseases.
Off-target genetic perturbations of A>I snRNAs
Next, we asked how U7smOPT snRNAs compared to cadRNAs with 
respect to off-target genetic perturbations. Selecting one guide for 
which cadRNA outperformed (RAB7A-targeting) and one for which 
U7smOPT snRNA outperformed (DMD-targeting), we conducted dif-
ferential gene expression analysis with DESeq2 on two replicates of RNA 
sequencing (RNA-seq) data from each condition compared to empty 
vector (significance cutoffs of |log2(fold change)| > 0.5 and adjusted P 
value < 0.05) (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Dataset 
1)25. In analyzing the data, we removed apparent overexpression of DMD 
because of a library preparation artifact, as applied in previous work 
(Supplementary Fig. 2)10. In either case, U7smOPT snRNA produced far 
fewer genetic perturbations (~4-8-fold) than cadRNA, in both upregu-
lated and downregulated genes. Notably, more misregulated genes are 
shared exclusively between the two cadRNA conditions (267 genes) 
than between the two DMD-targeting conditions (42 genes) or the two 
RAB7A-targeting conditions (121 genes) (Extended Data Fig. 2a). This 
paradox suggests that guide RNA-independent mechanisms dominate 
the off-target landscape. Pathway analysis with Metascape of perturbed 
genes conserved across both cadRNA conditions and absent from either 
U7smOPT snRNA condition showed notable downregulation of Herpes

simplex virus 1 infection and double-stranded break repair by syn-
thesis strand annealing (Extended Data Fig. 2a)26. These results imply 
that structured, stable cadRNAs may be inducing an innate immune 
response and acting as templates for homologous recombination, 
either of which would be highly problematic for cells.
While cadRNA may be more genetically perturbative overall, we 
expected U7smOPT snRNA to generate more splicing changes in the 
transcriptome. To test this hypothesis, we performed local splicing vari-
ation (LSV) analysis with MAJIQ of the RNA-seq datasets (significance 
cutoff of P value < 0.05) (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 3)27. Astonish-
ingly, for both guides across three different thresholds of differential 
percent spliced in (dPSI), cadRNA produced ~1.5-2-fold more signifi-
cant LSV events than U7smOPT snRNA. We attribute this unexpected 
finding not to directly guided splicing perturbations but rather to 
pleiotropic effects stemming from cadRNA-mediated downregula-
tion of splicing factors (24 versus 7 for DMD-targeting and 21 versus 3 
for RAB7A-targeting, cadRNA versus U7smOPT snRNA, respectively).
Lastly, we examined the number of off-target A>I editing events 
absent from both empty vector replicates and present across cadRNA 
and U7smOPT snRNA replicates with our established SAILOR pipeline 
(significance cutoff: >75% confidence) (Extended Data Fig. 2b)28. In the 
case of each guide, for both exonic and nonexonic edit sites and at vari-
ous edit fraction thresholds, U7smOPT snRNA generated consistently 
more transcriptome-wide A>I edits than cadRNA. While concerning, 
these increased off-target edits do not appear to contribute signifi-
cantly to transcriptome-wide genetic perturbations (Fig. 2). Moreover, 
they could be mitigated by reducing the guide length or by introduc-
ing mutations to disrupt RNA-RNA hybridization against concerning 
homology-mediated off-target sites.
Nuclear RNA base editing with A>I snRNAs
We reasoned that the seeming contradiction between higher 
cadRNA-mediated genetic perturbations and U7smOPT snRNA- 
mediated transcriptome-wide A>I edits could be reconciled by known 
more durable expression of cadRNAs (and accompanying antisense 
knockdown of transcripts) coupled with higher localization of  
U7smOPT snRNAs to the ADAR protein-enriched nucleoplasm. 
Whereas U snRNAs spend most of their life cycle in the nucleoplasm29, 
circular RNAs are actively exported to the cytosol30. This localization 
hypothesis would also explain why A>I snRNA (C-mismatch guide 
with U7smOPT snRNA backbone) outperforms cadRNA on high exon  
count gene mRNAs, which typically persist longer in the nucleus 
because of more extensive splicing before nuclear export.
To test the localization hypothesis, we devised a subcellular  
localization qPCR assay, whereby qPCR performed on both A>I scaf-
folded guides and genes from nuclear and cytosolic fractionated RNA 
enables inferred nuclear-to-cytosolic ratio comparison between A>I 
snRNA and cadRNA for equivalent guides (Fig. 3a). As expected, across 
three different guides, A>I snRNA localized more highly to the nucleus 
than cadRNA, with a sample-matched NEAT1 positive control show-
ing no significant difference in nuclear-to-cytosolic ratio between 
conditions (Fig. 3a). We orthogonally validated the enriched nuclear 
localization of A>I snRNA using single-molecule rolling circle amplifi-
cation fluorescence in situ hybridization (RCA FISH), demonstrating 
that A>I snRNAs reside ~2 μm closer to the nucleus on average and 
are ~70% more localized (~42% versus ~25%) within the nucleus than 
cadRNAs (Fig. 3b). Additionally, RCA FISH enabled us to quantify the 
expression of cadRNA relative to A>I snRNA, which is ~5-fold for the 
GAPDH guide and likely impacts relative A>I editing performance. 
Unlike the subcellular localization qPCR experiment in which cadRNA 
qPCR threshold cycles for nuclear and cytosolic fractions cancel  
each other out, cadRNA and A>I snRNA qPCR threshold cycles cannot 
be directly compared to each other because of differences in circular-
ized and linear templated strand-displacing complementary DNA 
(cDNA) synthesis.
Given this exciting nuclear localization discovery, we wondered 
whether A>I snRNAs could be leveraged to edit long noncoding RNAs 
(lncRNAs) and pre-mRNAs, applications not robustly demonstrated 
with single-component A>I programmable guided RNA scaffold 
modalities. To boost editing activity in these subsequent experiments, 
we engineered U7smOPT scaffold A>I snRNAs within a U1 promoter 
and U1 terminator cassette for more efficient construct expression 
(Extended Data Fig. 3). We first targeted three well-characterized 
lncRNAs: HOTAIR, MALAT1 and XIST (Fig. 4a). As predicted, A>I snRNA 
outperformed cadRNA in all cases. Next, we targeted pre-mRNA 3′ 
splice sites, whose disruption leads to exon exclusion (Fig. 4b). In 
addition to testing A>I snRNA and cadRNA, we included an antisense 
snRNA condition (C-mismatch eliminated from guide) to control for 
the effects of spliceosomal assembly steric hindrance. We first tested 
three 3′ splice site contexts for which native A>I editing has previously 
been implicated in splicing perturbation through ADAR knockdown: 
DENND4A, FBXL4 and PDE4DIP (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 4)31. 
A>I snRNAs edited all three pre-mRNA loci more efficiently than the 
other conditions, with editing rates ranging from ~10% to 30%. These 
increased editing rates modestly translated to improved exon skip-
ping of A>I snRNA over both cadRNA and antisense snRNA (DENND4A 
-dPSI, ~25% A>I snRNA versus ~5% antisense snRNA; FBXL4 -dPSI, 
~35% A>I snRNA versus ~29% antisense snRNA), except for PDE4DIP, 
in which case splicing changes fell below the sensitivity of the reverse 
transcription (RT)-PCR assay and a weakly editing cadRNA degraded 
the transcript. Lastly, we tested three additional 3′ splice site con-
texts for which CRISPR-Cas9 adenine deaminase base editing of DNA 
results in exon skipping (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 5)32. Again, 
A>I snRNA outperformed cadRNA in editing efficiency (~20-85%) and 
exon skipping (~10-65%). These splicing results indicate a new use of 
A>I snRNAs whose efficacy above antisense-mediated steric hindrance 
of spliceosomal assembly may depend largely on cis-splicing factors.
Increased pseudouridylation efficiency with U>Ψ snRNAs
Given our success in localizing A>I snRNAs to the nucleus for enhanced 
A>I editing, we applied a similar approach to U>Ψ RNA base editing.  
H/ACA box snoRNAs, which catalyze U>Ψ modification (editing) of  
rRNAs and snRNAs, localize predominantly to the nucleolus. We hypo­

H/ACA box snoRNAs through fusion to a U7smOPT snRNA backbone 
would direct the snoRNAs away from the nucleolus for more efficient 
U>Ψ editing on coding RNAs (Fig. 5a).
To test whether an snRNA approach could enhance U>Ψ editing, 
we designed a monocistronic, internally controlled dual-luminescence 
reporter harboring a cystic fibrosis-implicated PTC from human 
CFTRW1282X between Renilla luciferase (RLuc) and firefly luciferase (FLuc) 
(Fig. 5b). In a cotransfection experiment in HEK293T cells, expression 
of an established CFTR target-guided H/ACA box snoRNA increased 
the FLuc/RLuc luminescence ratio ~4-fold over a negative control IDUA 
target-guided H/ACA box snoRNA, validating the assay's sensitivity 
as a proxy for PTC readthrough. Of all linkers tested between CFTR 
target-guided H/ACA box snoRNA and U7smOPT snRNA backbone, 
both the (c)8 and (g)8 linkers (5′-cccccccc-3′ and 5′-gggggggg-3′) 
resulted in significant FLuc/RLuc luminescence ratio increases, with 
the (g)8 linker raising the luminescence ratio by ~70% above the snoRNA

condition, whereas a (g)8 tail without U7smOPT snRNA backbone 
had no significant effect. Pseudouridylation quantitation by bisulfite 
sequencing (BID-seq) revealed a concomitant U>Ψ editing rate increase 
of ~40% for (c)8 and (g)8 linker conditions (~70% editing) compared to 
the snoRNA condition (~50% editing), indicating a superlinear relation-
ship between protein-level PTC readthrough and pseudouridylation 
rates (Extended Data Fig. 4a-c)33. Meanwhile, neither the (a)8 nor the 
(u)8 linkers (5′-aaaaaaaa-3′ and 5′-uuuuuuuu-3′) increased the lumines-
cence ratio. Considering these results, we suspect that, unlike the other 
linkers tested, the (c)8 and (g)8 linkers help stabilize the expanded 
RNA scaffold. Potentially, the (c)8 and (g)8 linkers, when followed 
by U7smOPT snRNA backbone, form an endoribonuclease-resistant 
secondary structure that prevents 3′-end processing of the H/ACA 
box snoRNA. On the other hand, the (a)8 and (u)8 linkers may recruit 
poly(A)-binding and poly(U)-binding proteins, respectively, that desta-
bilize the construct.
We next tested the H/ACA box snoRNA-(g)8 linker-U7smOPT 
snRNA backbone fusions (U>Ψ snRNAs) on three endogenous loci 
in HEK293T cells and quantified the U>Ψ editing rate using targeted 
amplicon CMC sequencing (Fig. 5c and Extended Data Fig. 4d,e)16. On 
all three loci, two with statistical significance and one >2-fold, U>Ψ 
snRNAs outperformed H/ACA box snoRNAs as predicted (pseudouri-
dylation rates of ~20-40%). This generalization suggests that increased 
RNA-guided targeted pseudouridylation can be achieved without 
cytoplasmic DKC1 overexpression, a reportedly successful strategy 
that nevertheless poses the risk of promoting cancer progression16.
Given that U>Ψ snRNAs reproducibly enhance pseudouri-
dylation over H/ACA box snoRNAs, we sought to assess our work-
ing hypothesis of snRNA-mediated subcellular localization into the 
nucleoplasm and out of the nucleolus. However, RCA FISH of the EEF2 
guide on both U>Ψ editing RNA scaffolds did not conclusively dem-
onstrate either increased nuclear localization or decreased nucleolar 
localization of the U>Ψ snRNA compared to the H/ACA box snoRNA 
(Extended Data Fig. 5a). Notwithstanding these results, it is conceiv-
able that snRNAs may localize the constructs to other subnuclear 
structures such as nuclear speckles, where DKC1 has been found to 
reside34. As an alternative hypothesis, U>Ψ snRNAs may achieve higher 
cellular abundance through Sm core-mediated stabilization and, 
thus, greater construct-to-target stoichiometry. Guide-specific qPCR 
revealed this hypothesis to be the case for both CFTR-targeting and 
ACTB-targeting constructs but, importantly, for neither EEF2-targeting 
nor RPS6-targeting constructs (Extended Data Fig. 5b). Although we 
have not totally resolved the molecular mechanism of U>Ψ snRNA 
efficiency, we posit that the snRNA enhances pseudouridylation activ-
ity through a balance of both greater construct stability and presently 
undetermined subnuclear localization and effector recruitment.
Lastly, we tested the ability of the U>Ψ snRNA to improve NMD 
rescue in a human bronchial epithelial cystic fibrosis model (Fig. 5d). 
PTCs lead to NMD through the downstream presence of exon junction 
complexes, and PTC suppression rescues PTC-harboring mRNAs from 
NMD. We transduced 16HBE14o− cells harboring the CFTRW1282X muta-
tion with lentivirus encoding empty vector, CFTR-targeting snoRNA or 
previously optimized CFTR-targeting U>Ψ snRNA construct (Fig. 5a). 
Treatment with CFTR-targeting U>Ψ snRNA increased CFTR expression 
~2-fold when evaluated by qPCR against two distinct housekeeping 
genes (GAPDH and ANXA5). However, treatment with CFTR-targeting 
snoRNA at an equivalent transgene expression level did not achieve 
discernible NMD rescue. Encouragingly, this enhanced activity of U>Ψ 
snRNAs will enable lower dosage and, thus, safer therapeutics for the 
same PTC suppression efficacy.
Discussion
RNA base editing by programmable single-component guided RNA 
scaffolds has demonstrated promise as both a minimally invasive and 
a target-specific approach to gene editing. In this study, we engineered 
U snRNAs to enhance such systems for A>I and U>Ψ editing on mam-
malian transcripts. In either base editing case, snRNAs improved system 
safety and/or efficacy performance over state-of-the-art approaches, 
with an aspiration toward preclinical targeted suppression of PTC dis-
eases. Given that Sm core proteins are highly conserved and expressed 
in all mammalian cells, we expect our findings to translate effectively 
to other cell types and broadly to PTC disease therapeutics.
Excitingly, we showed in our study that U>Ψ snRNA significantly 
increases PTC readthrough over state-of-the-art engineered snoRNA 
in a human cellular disease model of cystic fibrosis. Given the general-
izability of enhanced pseudouridylation to other endogenous mRNA 
targets and an observed superlinear relationship between protein-level 
PTC readthrough and pseudouridylation rates, U>Ψ snRNAs likely 
could broadly advance the development of PTC disease gene therapies. 
Beyond genetically encoded gene therapies, U>Ψ snRNAs could also 
be administered to patients through nonviral delivery methods such 
as lipid nanoparticles. Here, the snRNA backbone may further aid in 
nuclear delivery, as snRNAs spend part of their life cycle at the cyto-
plasmic SMN complex before returning to the nucleus35.
More efficient genetically encodable single-component 
RNA-guided editing of RNA noncoding regions, including the 3′ splice 
sites of pre-mRNA, enables other therapeutic opportunities. For example,  
RNA base editor snRNAs could edit intronic RNA-binding protein (RBP) 
motifs to displace destabilizing RBPs and increase nuclear RNA expres-
sion. When coupled with single-component RNA-guided translational 
activation systems, RNA base editor snRNAs could provide an addi-
tional boost to protein expression36.
Importantly, snRNA enhancements to RNA base editing systems 
are guide independent, suggesting an approach that will benefit  
researchers even as they orthogonally optimize RNA guides for 
on-target base editing efficiency and specificity37. While our study 
focused on the U7smOPT snRNA backbone, there are likely further 
optimizations to be made to the sequence of the snRNA enhancement 
for augmented scaffold stability and nucleoplasmic RNA localization38. 
In addition to the H/ACA box snoRNA, we anticipate that snRNA compo-
nents could enhance programmable base editing by other noncoding 
RNAs, such as C/D box snoRNAs39-42. Future studies will undoubtedly 
explore these open questions and potential use cases.

Methods
Cloning of plasmids
gRNA and snoRNA plasmids (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2) were sub-
cloned into pUC19 (N3041S, New England Biolabs) and pcDNA 3.1(-) 
(V79520, Life Technologies Corporation) using EcoRI-HF and BamHI-HF 
digestion followed by Gibson assembly (E2611L, New England Biolabs). 
Lentiviral plasmids, containing CFTR-targeting small RNAs, were ordered 
as gene fragments (Twist) and similarly assembled into a lentiviral trans-
fer vector with an Ef1a core-eGFP-PuroR cassette (Supplementary Table 1) 
by Gibson assembly. Nonlentiviral Gibson assemblies were transformed 
into Mix & Go! competent cells JM109 (T3005, Zymo Research)  
and plated on Luria-Bertani (LB) agar with antibiotic. Lentiviral  
Gibson assemblies used One Shot Stbl3 chemically competent  
Escherichia coli (C737303, Thermo Fisher Scientific). All plasmids were 
cultured in LB medium with antibiotic, miniprepped using a QIAprep 
Spin miniprep kit and verified by sequencing and SnapGene analysis.
Cell culture
Human HEK 293T cells (632180, Takara Bio) and U-2 OS cells (HTB-96, 
American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in D10 (DMEM 
(4.5 g L−1 d-glucose) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco) and 1%  
penicillin-streptomycin (10,000 U per ml) (Gibco) at 37 °C with 5% 
CO2. Cells were periodically passaged once at 70-90% confluency by 
dissociating with TrypLE Express enzyme (Gibco) at a ratio of 1:10.
The 16HBE14o− CFTRW1282X human bronchial epithelial cells (Cystic  
Fibrosis Foundation) were cultured at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in 16HBE14o− expan-
sion medium (α-MEM (Sigma-Aldrich, M2279-500ML) supplemented 
with 10% FBS (Gibco), 1% GlutaMax (ThermoFisher Scientific) and 1% 
penicillin-streptomycin (10,000 U per ml) (Gibco)). Before cell plating, 
flasks were coated for ~2 h with an unrinsed fibronectin and collagen ECM 
mixture (97 ml of α-MEM, 2 ml of human fibronectin stock (0.5 mg ml−1 
in α-MEM; Sigma-Aldrich, F2006-5MG) and 1 ml of PureCol (3 mg ml−1 
in 0.01 N HCl; Sigma-Aldrich 5006-15MG)). Cells were passaged 1:10 
using TrypLE Express when 90-95% confluent. 16HBE14o− CFTRW1282X 
cells were genotyped by harvesting in QuickExtract DNA extraction 
solution (QE09050, LGC, Biosearch Technologies), followed by PCR 
with primers containing sequences 5′-GGTCAGGATTGAAAGTGTGCA-3′ 
and 5′-CTATGAGAAAACTGCACTGGA-3′, PCR purification and amplicon 
sequencing (Plasmidsaurus).
Transfections
HEK 293T cells (<30 passages) were transfected using jetOPTIMUS 
DNA transfection reagent (VWR International, 76299-632). For A>I RNA 
extractions, cells in 48-well plates were transfected at ~60% confluency 
with 250 ng of plasmid DNA. For U>Ψ RNA extractions, cells in 12-well 
plates were transfected at ~60% confluency with 1 µg of plasmid DNA. 
For luciferase reporter assays, cells in 96-well plates were transfected at 
~60% confluency with 100 ng of plasmid DNA (75 ng of guide and 25 ng 
of reporter). All transfections routinely achieved over 80% efficiency.
RNA extraction, A>I editing quantification and RNA-seq library 
preparation
First, 48 h after transfection, cells were washed twice with PBS and 
RNA was extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy Plus mini kit, eluting in 
30 µl. For A>I editing, cDNA was synthesized from 3 µl of RNA in a 10-µl 
volume using a New England Biolabs ProtoScript II first-strand cDNA 
synthesis kit and oligo(dT) primers. PCR was performed with 500 nM 
of specified primers (Supplementary Table 3) using NEBNext Ultra II Q5 
master mix, with a 68 °C Tm and 30-s extension for 30 cycles (mRNA) or 
32 cycles (pre-mRNA). PCR products were purified (Qiagen QIAquick) 
and Sanger-sequenced to quantify A>I editing. RNA-seq libraries were 
prepared from 1 µg of RNA using the Illumina stranded mRNA prep, liga-
tion kit (20040532, Illumina) following the manufacturer's protocol. 
Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq X Plus 10B (100-bp 
paired-end reads) with a target depth of ~50 million reads per sample.
Correlation modeling of U7smOPT snRNA versus cadRNA A>I 
editing
Analysis was performed on the 15 genes targeted in Fig. 1b,c. U7smOPT 
snRNA-to-cadRNA performance ratios were calculated as the ratios of 
the mean editing efficiencies for each respective target. Exon counts 
were taken from GRCh38.p14. Gene lengths were calculated as the dif-
ference between start and end base indices of genes from GENCODE 
version 44 (GRCh38.p14). Mean nuclear export rates of gene mRNAs 
were calculated as the average of two replicates of k_nucexp_from_
nucres.mean in K562 cells from Table S1 of Ietswaart et al.23. Pearson's 
linear correlation coefficients were taken for the performance ratio 
versus each hypothesis (exon count, gene length and mean nuclear 
export rate) across all targets. Data were analyzed and plotted in Matlab 
(version R2024a).
RNA-seq alignment
Reads were quality-checked and adaptor-trimmed with FastQC. Paired 
reads were then aligned to the GENCODE version 44 hg38 primary 
assembly using STAR aligner (version 2.7.6a). A genome index was 
built using GRCh38.primary_assembly.genome.fa, gencode.v44.pri-
mary_assembly.annotation.gtf and '--sjdbOverhang 100'. FASTQ files 
were mapped with default options and '--outSAMtype BAM unsorted'. 
SAMtools (version 1.3.1) sorted and indexed the resulting BAM files.
Differential gene expression analysis
Differential expression analysis of RNA-seq reads involved Subread fea-
tureCounts (version 1.5.3) for gene quantification and DESeq2 (version 
1.39.3) for identifying differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Subread 
featureCounts generated gene count matrices from paired-end reads, 
using parameters such as gencode.v44.primary_assembly.annotation.
gtf, exon features and filtering for primary alignments, quality score 
(Q255) and duplicate reads. These matrices were loaded into R and 
converted to DESeq2 datasets; genes with no expression were removed. 
DESeq2::DESeq identified DEGs using default parameters, with results 
saved as .csv files. Volcano plots were generated using RNAlysis 2 
(version 3.9.2) with a significance threshold of adjusted P < 0.05 and 
log2(fold change) > 0.5. Principal component analysis plots were also 
created with RNAlysis 2 after normalizing counts by relative log expres-
sion and filtering low-expression genes. Gene set enrichment analysis 
(GSEA) (version 4.3.2) was performed on ranked gene lists, filtered by 
a log2(fold change) threshold of ±0.5. Ranking metrics were calculated 
as the sum of the product of the log2(fold change) and −log10(P value). 
GSEA used the c5.go.bp.v2023.2.Hs.symbols.gmt gene set and classic 
enrichment statistics. DMD was excluded from lists for DMD-targeting 
guide RNAs because of an artifact. Full DESeq2 outputs are in Supple-
mentary Dataset 1.
Gene pathway analysis
Significantly upregulated and downregulated genes identified in 
both cadRNA datasets but not in either U7smOPT snRNA dataset 
were analyzed for gene pathway significance with Metascape (version 
3.5.20240101) using as background all genes without an 'NA' adjusted 
P value in all replicates of cadRNA and U7smOPT snRNA datasets from 
the DESeq2 pipeline.
Differential splicing analysis
Splicing variations across cadRNA, U7 smOPT and pUC19 controls were 
assessed using MAJIQ and VOILA (version 2.5). MAJIQ builder created 
splice graphs and MAJIQ quantifier measured the dPSI of LSVs at known 
splice sites. VOILA TSV selected genes with P(|dPSI| > x) > 0.95. PRISM 
and R were used for plotting.
Splicing factor analysis
Significantly perturbed splicing factors were identified as a subset of 
significantly upregulated and downregulated genes from both cadRNA

and U7 smOPT datasets contained within the Gene Ontology biological 
process RNA splicing (GO:0008380)
Transcriptome-wide A>I editing analysis
Transcriptome-wide RNA editing was quantified using SAILOR (version 
1.1.0). Aligned reads were processed to generate base quality MD tags 
with sAMtools (version 1.3.1) calmd -b and the GENCODE version 44 
GRCh38.primary_assembly.genome.fa sequence. Reads with MD tags 
were analyzed using the SAILOR cwl workflow, using the same reference 
genome as for alignment and MD tag generation. Edit sites required a 
SAILOR confidence level exceeding 0.75 for significance. Exonic sites 
intersected with 'exon' features from gencode.v44.primary_assem-
bly.annotation.gtf using 'BEDTools intersect -s -wa -a'. All other sites 
were classified as nonexonic. Edit fraction thresholds were applied to 
SAILOR's post-pseudocount edit percentage output.
Subcellular localization qPCR
Cells were washed twice with ice cold PBS and then spun down for 
5 min at 300g, before aspirating the supernatant. Cells were then resus-
pended completely by gentle pipetting with 150 μl of buffer A (15 mM 
Tris-HCl pH 8, 15 mM NaCl, 60 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA pH 8, 0.5 mM EGTA 
pH 8, 0.5 mM spermidine and 10 U per ml SUPERase•In RNase Inhibitor 
(AM2694, Thermo Fisher Scientific)). To this solution, 150 μl of 2× lysis 
buffer (buffer A with 0.5% NP-40) was added and mixed by inversion. 
The mixture was incubated for 8 min at 4 °C and then spun down for 
5 min at 400g. The top 200 μl of supernatant was carefully removed 
and placed into a new tube (the cytosolic fraction). The remaining 
supernatant was removed and discarded from the nuclear pellet and 
this pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of RLN buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 
8, 140 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.5% NP-40, 10 mM EDTA pH 8, 10 U per 
ml SUPERase•In RNase inhibitor (AM2694, Thermo Fisher Scientific)). 
This nuclear resuspension was incubated for 5 min at 4 °C. During the 
incubation, the cytosolic fraction was spun again for 1 min at 500g and 
its supernatant was collected into a new tube. Next, 500 μl of Trizol LS 
(10296010, Invitrogen) was added to this cytosolic fraction. The nuclear 
fraction was spun down once more for 5 min at 500g. Supernatant 
was removed from the nuclear fraction pellet and 500 μl of TRIzol 
(15596018, Invitrogen) was added to the nuclear fraction pellet. To 
both TRIzol homogenizations was added 1 μl of GlycoBlue coprecipi-
tant (AM9516, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Then, RNA was extracted by 
phenol-chloroform extraction, followed by ethanol precipitation.
cDNA synthesis was carried out using the ProtoScript II first-strand 
cDNA synthesis kit (E6560L, New England Biolabs) with 6 μl of RNA in a 
20-μl total volume using random hexamer primers supplied with the kit. 
Before qPCR, nuclear fraction cDNA was diluted 1:2 with nuclease-free 
water and cytosolic fraction cDNA was diluted 1:60 with nuclease-free 
water. qPCR with 500 nM of specified primers (Supplementary Table 3) 
was carried out using PowerTrack SYBR green master mix (A46109, 
Thermo Fisher Scientific) using the CFX Opus 384 (Bio-Rad) and qPCR 
parameters of 95 °C for 2 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s 
and 60 C°C for 1 min. From the qPCR Cq values, subcellular (nuclear 
and cytosolic), guide and NEAT1 expression levels were normalized 
relative to their subcellular GAPDH expression controls; then, the ratio 
of these normalized subcellular expressions was calculated. Data were 
analyzed and plotted in Matlab (version R2024a).
Splicing isoform quantification
For splicing isoform quantification, cDNA synthesis was carried out 
using the ProtoScript II first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (E6560L, New 
England Biolabs) with 3 μl of RNA in a 10-μl total volume using oligo(dT) 
primers supplied with the kit. PCR with 500 nM of specified primers 
(Supplementary Table 3) was carried out using NEBNext Ultra II Q5 
master mix (M0544L, New England Biolabs) with a Tm of 68 °C and 30-s 
extension time for 32 cycles. PCR products were purified by a QIAquick 
PCR purification kit (28106, Qiagen), with 50% of eluted volume run 
on 2% E-Gel EX agarose gels(G402022, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for  
~15 min with E-Gel ultralow-range DNA ladder (10488096, Thermo Fisher  
Scientific) and E-Gel 50-bp DNA ladder (10488099, Thermo Fisher 
Scientific). Gels were visualized using the Azure Biosystems c600. 
Gel bands were quantitated using GelAnalyzer (version 19.1), with PSI 
values calculated after adjusting bands for relative molecular weights.
Luciferase reporter assay
The cell medium was changed 48 h after transfection. Luminescence 
was measured using a Tekan Infinite 200Pro plate reader (Costar 96 
flat white setting, automatic attenuation) and Promega's Dual-Glo 
luciferase assay system (E2920). Integration times were 500 ms for 
FLuc and 100 ms for RLuc. Data were analyzed and plotted in Matlab 
(version R2024a).
In vitro transcription of pseudouridine standards
Template DNA was first generated by a two-stage PCR on a DNA oligo  
containing the respective target sequence context (Supplementary  
Table 3). First, the oligo was PCR-amplified for two cycles with pseudo­
uridylation standard primers (PCR1). This PCR amplicon was then 
used as a template for a 15-cycle reaction with PCR2. The resulting  
PCR amplicon was PAGE-purified and divided into two T7 in vitro 
transcription reactions (MEGAshortscript, Invitrogen), containing 
the standard triphosphate pool (for unmodified standards) or with 
substitution of UTP for ΨTP (for pseudouridine standards). After a 
120-min in vitro transcription, the reaction was treated with DNase 
(Turbo DNase, Invitrogen) and RNA was purified by PAGE before use 
in CMC or BID-seq reactions.
Targeted BID-seq
BID-seq33 began with bisulfite treatment using 8.5 μl of DNaseI-treated 
total RNA, mixing it with 45 μl of 2.4 M Na2SO3 and 0.36 M NaHSO3 and 
heating at 70 °C for 3 h. The reaction was diluted with 75 μl of RNase-free 
water, combined with 270 μl of RNA-binding buffer and 400 μL ethanol 
and loaded onto a Zymo RNA clean and concentrator-5 column. The col-
umn was washed with 200 μl of RNA wash buffer and then incubated for 
90 min at room temperature with 200 μl of RNA desulfonation buffer. 
After clearing the desulfonation buffer, the column was washed twice 
with 700 μl of RNA wash buffer. Bisulfite-treated RNA was eluted in 
10.5 μl of nuclease-free water. For RT, 5 μl of treated RNA was combined 
with 1 μl of 50 mM random hexamers or 10 mM dNTPs and 6 μl of water, 
annealed at 65 °C for 5 min and snap-chilled. The primer-annealed RNA 
underwent RT with 4 μl of 5× SSIV buffer, 100 mM DTT, 1 μl of RNasein 
Plus and 1 μl of SSIV, incubated at 23 °C for 10 min, 55 °C for 10 min and 
80 °C for 10 min. RNA hydrolysis involved adding 5 μl of 1 M NaOH and 
heating at 95 °C for 5 min, before quenching with 5 μl of 1 M HCl. The 
resulting cDNA was purified using MyOne Silane Dynabeads and eluted 
in 20 μl of nuclease-free water. Gene-specific PCR amplification used 
primers from Supplementary Table 3. PCR products were purified with 
AMPure XP beads, pooled equally and sent for amplicon sequencing. 
Raw FASTQ files were aligned to target references using bbmap; BAM 
files were sorted and indexed with SAMtools. Deletion rates were quan-
tified per position using SAMtools mpileup and custom Python scripts. 
Effective pseudouridylation rates were calculated by normalizing to 
the 100% ΨTP CFTR synthetic RNA standard. Data were analyzed and 
plotted in Matlab (version R2024a).
Targeted amplicon CMC sequencing
To disrupt RNA secondary structure, 5 μg of RNA in ~10 μl of 
nuclease-free water was incubated at 80 °C for 5 min and then chilled 
on ice. Denatured RNA was transferred to 100 μl of BEU buffer (50 mM 
bicine pH 8.5, 4 mM EDTA and 7 M urea) with 0.2 M CMC (C106402-1G, 
Sigma-Aldrich), incubated at 37 °C for 20 min and purified by ethanol  
precipitation. Pellets were dissolved in 50 μl of Na2CO3 buffer (50 mM 
Na2CO3 pH 10.4 and 2 mM EDTA), incubated at 37 °C for 2 h and

purified by ethanol precipitation. Pellets were redissolved in 10 μl 
of nuclease-free water. For RT, 2 μl of random hexamer primers from 
the SuperScript first-strand synthesis system for RT-PCR (11904018, 
Thermo Fisher Scientific) were added, denatured at 65 °C for 5 min and 
chilled on ice. Then, 8 μl of freshly prepared 2.5× RT buffer (125 mM Tris 
pH 8.0, 15 mM MnCl2, 187.5 mM KCl, 1.25 mM dNTPs and 25 mM DTT) 
was added before incubating at 25 °C for 2 min. Next, 1 μl of SuperScript 
II reverse transcriptase from the SuperScript first-strand synthesis 
system for RT-PCR (11904018, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added. 
Reactions ran at 25 °C for 10 min, 42 °C for 3 h and 70 °C for 15 min.
Library preparation involved two PCR steps. First, PCR with 
500 nM locus-specific primers (Supplementary Table 3) used 1 μl of 
cDNA with NEBNext Ultra II Q5 master mix (M0544L, New England Bio-
labs) in 10 μl (Tm 65 °C) with a 30-s extension for 15 cycles. Products were 
cleaned with 1.8× AMPure XP beads (A63881, Beckman Coulter), eluted 
in 11 μl. Second, PCR with 500 nM next-generation sequencing universal 
barcoded primers (Supplementary Table 3) used 10 μl of first-round 
product with NEBNext Ultra II Q5 master mix (M0544L, New England 
Biolabs) in 20 μl (Tm 65 °C) with a 30-s extension for 15 cycles. Products 
were pooled, purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (28106, 
Qiagen) and run on 2% E-Gel EX agarose gels (G402022, Thermo Fisher 
Scientific) for ~15 min. The ~250-bp upper band was extracted and 
purified using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (28704, Qiagen) before 
sequencing. The library was sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq X Plus 
10B (150-bp paired-end reads), targeting ~5 million reads per sample.
FASTQ files were collapsed along UMI (unique molecular identi-
fier) using the first occurrence of a 10-mer UMI. Only sequences with 
perfect 8-mer matches upstream or downstream of target NΨN were 
considered. Deletion rates were calculated as the fraction of total 
sequences at a locus with 2 nt between perfect 8-mer matches. Muta-
tion rates were calculated as the fraction of total sequences at a locus 
with 3 nt between perfect 8-mer matches and no T at the Ψ position 
in target NΨN. Effective pseudouridylation rates were normalized to 
100% ΨTP ACTB, EEF2 and RPS6 synthetic RNA standards. Data were 
analyzed and plotted in Matlab (version R2024a).
Guide-specific qPCR to quantitate construct expression
First, 48 h after transfection, HEK293T cells were washed twice with PBS; 
then, RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Plus mini kit (74136, Qiagen) 
with an elution volume of 30 μl. cDNA synthesis was carried out using 
the ProtoScript II first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (E6560L, New England 
Biolabs) with 3 μl of RNA in a 10-μl total volume using two different reac-
tions per replicate: random hexamer primers supplied with the kit for 
GAPDH quantitation and the primer used as the reverse qPCR primer 
for guide quantification (Supplementary Table 3). Before qPCR, cDNA 
was diluted 1:3 with nuclease-free water. qPCR with 500 nM specified 
primers (Supplementary Table 3) was carried out using the PowerUp 
SYBR green master mix (A25742, Thermo Fisher Scientific) with the 
CFX96 (Bio-Rad) and qPCR parameters of 50 °C for 2 min and 95 °C for 
2 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. From 
the qPCR Cq values, guide expression levels were normalized relative 
to GAPDH. Data were analyzed and plotted in Matlab (version R2024a).
RCA FISH experiment
U-2 OS cells (<20 passages) were seeded into 96-well glass-bottom 
microplates (Greiner Bio-One SensoPlate, 07-000-109). Plasmids were 
transfected into ~30% confluent cells using jetOPTIMUS DNA transfec-
tion reagent (76299-632, VWR International). Three bioreplicate wells 
per condition received 12.5 ng of plasmid DNA for A>I RNA RCA FISH 
and 25 ng for U>Ψ RNA RCA FISH. Cells were cultured to ~80% conflu-
ency and then incubated at 65 °C for 5 min, followed by rapid ice cooling 
before fixation. Cells were fixed for 30 min at room temperature in 4% 
(w/v) paraformaldehyde (PFA; Electron Microscopy Sciences, 15714) 
and 0.007% (v/v) glutaraldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences, 16120) 
in 1× PBS (Ambion, AM9625). After three 1× PBS washes, cells were 
permeabilized with 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 in 1× PBS for 10 min at room 
temperature. Permeabilization solution was removed by three washes 
with PBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween-20 (PBS-T; VWR, 100216-360).
Target snRNAs and snoRNAs were reverse-transcribed in situ. 
Each 50-μl well reaction contained 1× SuperScript IV buffer (Lifetech, 
18090050), 500 μM of each dNTP (New England Biolabs, N0447L), 
1 μM RT primer (Integrated DNA Technologies), 0.2 mg ml−1 BSA  
(New England Biolabs, B9200S), 0.8 U per μl RNase inhibitor (M0314L 
or Thermo Fisher Scientific, EO0384) and 20 U per μl of SuperScript IV 
reverse transcriptase (Lifetech, 18090050) in RNase-free water. Plates 
were sealed and incubated overnight (approximately 16-18 h) at 37 °C. 
Following RT, cells were washed three times with PBS-T and postfixed 
for 30 min at room temperature in 1× PBS with 3% (w/v) PFA and 0.1% 
(v/v) glutaraldehyde. Cells were washed five times with PBS-T. Padlock 
probe ligation was performed in a 50-μl well reaction with 1× Ampligase 
buffer (Lucigen, A3210K), 100 nM padlock probe (Integrated DNA Tech-
nologies, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-purified), 
0.2 mg ml−1 BSA, 0.4 U per μl of RNase H (Enzymatics, Y9220L) and 0.5 U 
per μl of Ampligase (Lucigen, A3210K). The reaction incubated at 37 °C 
for 30 min and then 45 °C for 45 min on a thermocycler with a heated 
lid. Cells were then washed three times with PBS-T.
Ligated padlock probes were amplified by RCA. The 50-μl reaction 
mix per well, prepared on ice, contained 1× Phi29 buffer (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific, EP0091), 5% (v/v) glycerol (Sigma-Aldrich, G5516), 250 μM 
of each dNTP, 0.2 mg ml−1 BSA and 1 U per μl Phi29 DNA polymerase 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, EP0091) (added last to chilled mixture). 
Plates were sealed (adjacent empty wells contained water for humidity) 
and incubated overnight (approximately 18 h) at 30 °C. After RCA, cells 
were washed three times with PBS-T. RCA products were detected by 
hybridization with fluorescently labeled hybridization probes (Inte-
grated DNA Technologies, HPLC-purified). The 100-μl hybridization 
mix per well contained 1 μM hybridization probe in hybridization buffer 
(2× saline sodium citrate (Ambion, AM9763) and 10% (v/v) formamide). 
Hybridization was for 30 min at room temperature, followed by three 
PBS-T washes. Nucleoli were stained with 1 μM nucleolar red in 1× PBS 
for 5 min. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI.
Fluorescence imaging used a Squid microscopy system (Cepha-
logics) with a pentaband filter set (laser lines at 405, 470, 550, 640 and 
730 nm) and an IMX571 camera. An Olympus ×10 (0.8 numerical aperture) 
Plan Apo objective was used. Excitation wavelengths were 405 nm (DAPI), 
561 nm (nucleolar red) and 638 nm (TYE665). For A>I RNA RCA FISH, nine 
images (~10,000-20,000 cells total) were taken per well. For U>Ψ RNA 
RCA FISH, 13 images (~20,000-40,000 cells total) were taken per well.
RCA FISH analysis
RCA FISH images were analyzed using a custom CellProfiler (version 
4.2.8) pipeline. Nuclei were identified in 405 filter images (10-40-pixel 
diameter) using IdentifyPrimaryObjects with a global, minimum 
cross-entropy thresholding method (smoothing scale, 1.3488; cor-
rection factor, 1.0; bounds, 0.2-1.0). Clumped objects were divided by 
shape and intensity. Cell boundaries were identified by expanding 20 
pixels using ExpandOrShinkObjects. RCA rolonies were identified in 
640 filter images (1-10-pixel diameter) using IdentifyPrimaryObjects 
with similar global, minimum cross-entropy thresholding (smooth-
ing scale, 1.3488; correction factor, 1.0; bounds, 0.07-1.0). Clumped 
objects were divided by shape and intensity. Only rolonies within cell 
boundaries were counted (RelateObjects). For U>Ψ RNA RCA FISH 
images, nucleoli were identified in 550 filter images (1-7-pixel diameter) 
using IdentifyPrimaryObjects with an adaptive, robust background 
thresholding method (outlier fractions, 0.05; mean and s.d. methods, 
1.5 deviations; smoothing scale, 0.674; correction factor, 1; bounds, 
0.02-1.0; adaptive window, 7). Clumped objects were divided by inten-
sity. Only nucleoli within nuclei were counted (RelateObjects).
Edge-to-edge distances between RCA rolonies and nuclei  
and nucleoli were determined first by binarizing nuclei and nucleoli

(ConvertObjectsToImage) and then inverting (ImageMath, invert 
operation, standard scaling and clamping). A distance map was gen-
erated from these inverted images using Morph (distance operation). 
Finally, MeasureObjectIntensity calculated edge-to-edge distances 
as Intensity_MinIntensityEdge values, with 0 assigned if rolonies were 
within nuclei or nucleoli. RCA rolonies were considered localized within 
nuclei or nucleoli if they were children of nuclei or nucleoli (Relate-
Objects). Data were analyzed and plotted in Matlab (version R2024a).
Cystic fibrosis disease modeling
Lentivirus was produced by seeding 8 × 106 LentiX cells in a 10-cm 
dish 24 h before transfection. Virus particles were packaged using 
standard three-plasmid transfection with VirusGen reagent. Super-
natants were collected 72 h after transfection, filtered (0.45-μm 
PVDF), concentrated by PEG precipitation (LentiX concentrator), 
snap-frozen and stored at −80 °C. Functional titers were deter-
mined on HEK293T cells by eGFP flow cytometry. For transduction, 
200,000 16HBE14o− CFTRW1282X cells were seeded on ECM-coated 
48-well plates 24 h beforehand. Cells were spin-transduced with 
titer-adjusted virus in PBS containing 5 μg ml−1 polybrene at 1,000 rcf 
for 15 min at 37 °C. The medium was changed after 48 h. Cul-
tures were expanded over 3 weeks to 10-cm dishes, with 1.5 μg ml−1 
puromycin selection on days 7-14 to prevent nontransduced cell  
expansion. Cells were then washed, scraped, pelleted and snap-frozen.
RNA was extracted from cell pellets using the RNeasy Plus mini 
kit (74136, Qiagen) with an elution volume of 30 μl. cDNA synthesis 
was carried out using the ProtoScript II first-strand cDNA synthesis 
kit (E6560L, New England Biolabs) with 6 μl of RNA in a 20-μl total  
volume using oligo(dT) primers supplied with the kit. qPCR with 
500 nM of specified primers (Supplementary Table 3) was carried out 
using PowerTrack SYBR green master mix (A46109, Thermo Fisher 
Scientific) with the CFX Opus 384 (Bio-Rad) and qPCR parameters of 
95 °C for 2 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 C°C for 
1 min. From the qPCR Cq values, CFTR and PuroR expression levels were 
normalized relative to GAPDH and ANXA5 housekeeping genes. Data 
were analyzed and plotted in Matlab (version R2024a).
