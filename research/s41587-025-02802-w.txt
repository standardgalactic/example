Base editors create precise genomic edits by directing nucleobase 
deamination or removal without inducing double-stranded DNA breaks. 
However, a vast chemical space of other DNA modifications remains to be 
explored for genome editing. Here we harness the bacterial antiphage toxin 
DarT2 to append ADP-ribosyl moieties to DNA, unlocking distinct editing 
outcomes in bacteria versus eukaryotes. Fusing an attenuated DarT2 to a 
Cas9 nickase, we program site-specific ADP-ribosylation of thymines within 
a target DNA sequence. In tested bacteria, targeting drives homologous 
recombination, offering flexible and scar-free genome editing without 
base replacement or counterselection. In tested yeast, plant and human 
cells, targeting drives substitution of the modified thymine to adenine 
or a mixture of adenine and cytosine with limited insertions or deletions, 
offering edits inaccessible to current base editors. Altogether, our approach, 
called append editing, leverages the addition of chemical moieties to DNA to 
expand current modalities for precision gene editing.
In the expanding field of genome editing, targeting chemical modi-
fications to a specific DNA sequence offers an effective way to create 
precise genomic edits without relying on double-stranded (ds)DNA 
breaks1-3. These modifications are installed at selected sites by base edi-
tors (BEs) comprising an enzymatic DNA domain and a programmable 
DNA binding protein. After the BE acts on recognized bases within a 
selected target site, the modified bases then change identity, resulting 
in a permanent genetic substitution. As this process does not actively 
generate dsDNA breaks at the target site, unintended and possibly 
harmful genetic alterations such as random insertions or deletions 
(indels), chromosomal abnormalities or chromothripsis are avoided1,4. 
To date, BEs have been applied in all three domains of life5,6 including 
DNA-containing organelles such as mitochondria7; they can convert 
each of the four bases6 and have recently entered clinical use8.
Within these advances, BEs have consistently relied on DNA 
deaminases to remove an amino group, changing the base's perceived 
identity, or on DNA glycosylases to remove the entire base, driving 
the base's replacement through base excision repair2,9. While such 
'subtractive' DNA modifications represent powerful means to elicit 
precise gene edits, what remains unexplored is the impact of 'addi-
tive' DNA modifications. Extensive work in DNA repair has shown that 
appended chemical moieties can elicit diverse DNA repair pathways,

such as homologous recombination, translesion synthesis, nucleotide 
excision repair or Fanconi anemia repair, extending well beyond base 
excision repair10-12. However, the programmable addition of chemical 
moieties to DNA for gene editing remains to be explored.
One promising starting point derives from the DNA ADP- 
ribosyltransferase protein DarT2 (ref. 13). DarT2 is part of the DarT2/
DarG toxin-antitoxin system recently associated with a growing col-
lection of antiphage defenses (Fig. 1a)14. As the system's toxin, DarT2 
appends a single ADP-ribosyl (ADPr) moiety to the N3 position of thy-
mine in single-stranded (ss)DNA using the metabolic cofactor NAD+ 
as a substrate15. The antitoxin DarG protein catalytically removes the 
appended ADPr moiety and also serves as a DNA mimic that binds 
DarT2 (ref. 16). During a phage infection, DarG is inactivated through an 
unknown mechanism and DarT2 begins ADP-ribosylating DNA within 
the bacteriophage and host genome14. An appended ADPr moiety inter-
feres with DNA replication, which can block bacteriophage replication 
and induce cellular growth arrest. In Escherichia coli, growth arrest can 
be partially relieved through bypass by RecF-mediated homologous 
recombination with the sister chromatid followed by removal through 
nucleotide excision repair (Fig. 1b)17. Critically, this mode of repair 
contrasts with traditional base editing in this bacterium18,19, suggesting 
that the installation of an ADPr moiety could unlock distinct types of 
genome edits. Here, we explore such an approach, which we call append 
editing. As we append an ADPr moiety to thymine, the approach can be 
abbreviated as ADPr-T append editing, or ADPr-TAE.
Results
CRISPR-guided ADP-ribosylation drives homologous 
recombination in E. coli
To explore the outcome of targeted DNA ADP-ribosylation, we selected 
the previously characterized DarT2 from enteropathogenic E. coli 
(EPEC) O127:H6 str. E2348/69 (ref. 17). EPEC DarT2 was shown to 
ADP-ribosylate single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) at the third position in 
a 5′-TYTN-3′ motif (Y = C/T), with the fourth position biased against a G17.  
Paralleling its growth-inhibitory effects in vivo, this DarT2 blocked 
extension by the large fragment of E. coli's DNA polymerase I in vitro 
from a ssDNA template with the recognition motif (5′-TCTC-3′), whereas 
extension was unhindered with a mutated motif (5′-ACTC-3′) or with 
DarT2 containing the inactivating E170A substitution (dDarT2) (Fig. 1c,d 
and Extended Data Fig. 1)17.
To direct DNA ADP-ribosylation, we fused DarT2 to the N terminus 
of the protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM)-flexible (5′-NNG-3′) Strep-
tococcus canis Cas9 (ScCas9) (Fig. 1e)20. Directing the DarT2-Cas9 
fusion to a target sequence through a designed single guide (sg)RNA 
would localize DarT2 to the nontarget strand displaced during R-loop 
formation (Fig. 1e). If the non-target strand contains a 5′-TYTN-3′ 
motif accessible to DarT2, then the target thymine within the motif 
would be ADP-ribosylated and serve as a block to DNA replication. As 
wild-type (WT) DarT2 would arrest cell growth through genome-wide 
ADP-ribosylation, we included a previously reported spontaneous 
G49D substitution in the NAD+-binding loop helix (DarT2D) exhibit-
ing reduced cytotoxicity17. To promote repair through a provided 
DNA template rather than the sister chromatid, we used a nickase ver-
sion of Cas9 (D10A) that only cleaves the target strand and provided 
a plasmid-encoded repair template with ~500-bp homology arms 
flanking the intended edits.
As a simple readout of homologous recombination, we introduced 
a premature stop codon into a chromosomally integrated kanamycin 
resistance gene in E. coli strain MG1655 (Fig. 1f). The premature stop 
codon overlaps with an ScCas9 target containing the 5′-TTTC-3′ DarT2 
motif and a PAM sequence, while a provided repair template with 
~500-bp homology arms introduces mutations that revert the pre-
mature stop codon and remove the DarT2 motif. As part of an editing 
assay, plasmids encoding the editor, sgRNA and repair template are 
transformed into E. coli and colony counts are compared following 
editor induction and plating with or without kanamycin.
To set a baseline, we applied dsDNA cleavage with Cas9, which is 
commonly used for genome editing in bacteria21. As dsDNA cleavage

principally removes cells that did not undergo recombination, using 
Cas9 resulted in an average of 76% kanamycin-resistant colonies and a 
153-fold colony reduction compared to the nontargeting (NT) control 
(P = 0.0002, n = 3) (Fig. 1g). The nickase version of Cas9 did not deplete 
colony counts (3.7-fold increase relative to the NT control, P = 0.02, 
n = 3) but at the expense of fewer kanamycin-resistant colonies (5.1%), 
in line with nicking being less cytotoxic but a poor driver of homolo-
gous recombination. Binding DNA alone with a catalytically dead Cas9 
(dCas9) exhibited similar colony counts to nCas9 (P = 0.07, n = 3) and 
did not drive any measurable editing.

Turning to append editing with DarT2, the DarT2D-nCas9 fusion 
yielded an average of 97% kanamycin-resistant colonies and negligible 
depletion in colony counts compared to its NT control (1.7-fold increase; 
P = 0.25, n = 3) (Fig. 1g). Both DNA ADP-ribosylation and opposite-strand 
nicking were important, as conferring kanamycin resistance was less 
effective with nicking alone (dDarT2-nCas9, 0.18%; P = 0.003, n = 3) 
or ADP-ribosylation alone (DarT2D-dCas9, 43%; P = 0.029, n = 3) when 
compared to DarT2D-nCas9. All screened kanamycin-resistant colonies 
contained the intended edit (Extended Data Fig. 2). DarT2D still con-
ferred cytotoxicity, as cell counts were low even for the NT controls and 
increased upon deactivation of DarT2 (Fig. 1g), creating an opportunity 
to further attenuate the toxin. Collectively, append editing with DarT2 
drives homologous recombination with a provided template in E. coli, 
yielding editing that outperforms traditional Cas9-based approaches 
but with target-independent cytotoxicity.
Targeted ADP-ribosylation does not induce detectable base 
edits in E. coli
Our reporter assay requires homologous recombination to confer kana-
mycin resistance. However, chemically modifying DNA bases can lead 
to single-nucleotide edits as demonstrated by BEs18,22. We, therefore, 
asked whether append editing could drive editing without antibiotic 
selection but also induce base mutagenesis. First, we repeated the 
kanR reporter assay in the absence of kanamycin selection and per-
formed amplicon sequencing on the target site from liquid culture 
(Fig. 1h). Under targeting conditions, append editing yielded 82% of 
total reads with the desired edit that drastically dropped with nicking 
alone (0.9%), paralleling the fraction of kanamycin-resistant colonies 
(Fig. 1g). Of the remaining reads, the few detected substitutions of 
the ADP-ribosylated thymine were not significantly elevated in any 
particular sample (F = 1.03, P = 0.39, df = 3) (Extended Data Fig. 3). As 
homologous recombination could overshadow base editing, we per-
formed the assay in the absence of the repair template. However, the 16 
screened colonies only yielded the original sequence (Supplementary 
Fig. 1). Therefore, append editing with DarT2 did not result in detectable 
base edits in E. coli, further supporting sole triggering of homologous 
recombination.
Base editing can also occur at genomic sites unrelated to the target 
sequence presumably through the DNA modification domain acting on 
temporary ssDNA23. Given the lack of obvious substitutions at the target 
site with append editing, we hypothesized that DarT2 expression would 
not lead to such edits associated with BEs. Culturing editor-expressing 
cells and performing whole-genome sequencing of three individual 
clones (Fig. 1i and Supplementary Table 1), a cytosine BE (CBE) yielded 
the expected C-to-T edits23, with either three or eight edits in each 
clone. In contrast, the ADPr-TA editor yielded no T-to-G edits and few 
T-to-C edits similarly to the CBE or no editor. One of the three clones 
with the ADPr-TA editor yielded a single T-to-A edit, whereas none were 
observed with the CBE or no editor. This one edit was associated with 
the 5′-TYTN-3′ motif, suggesting that base mutagenesis is possible 
but rare (Supplementary Table 1). Thus, even a highly active DarT2 
that reduces cell viability (Fig. 1g) does not inherently drive base edits 
across the E. coli genome.
Attenuating DarT2 alleviates cytotoxicity without 
compromising homologous recombination
ADPr-TAE yielded high editing efficiencies, although the expressed 
DarT2D exhibited strong cytotoxicity (Fig. 1g). As the cytotoxicity 
was likely because of ADP-ribosylation of ssDNA across the genome, 
we aimed to attenuate DarT2 without compromising localized 
ADP-ribosylation and subsequent initiation of homologous recombi-
nation using structural insights and sequence conservation (Fig. 2a). 
While the structure of EPEC DarT2 remains to be experimentally deter-
mined, a crystal structure is available for the Thermus sp. 2.9 DarT2 
that shares 34% amino acid identity with EPEC DarT2 (ref. 15). Aligning 
this structure with the AlphaFold-predicted structure of EPEC DarT2  
(ref. 24), we selected a subset of residues potentially involved in binding 
the DNA recognition motif (M84, M86, R57, R92 and R166) or potentially 
flanking regions of the DNA strand not captured in the crystal structure 
(R193). The positively charged arginines were substituted to uncharged 
alanine, while the methionines were substituted to leucine to disrupt 
the coordinating sulfur while preserving the residue's hydrophobic-
ity and chain length. Testing these substitutions in combination with 
G49D as part of the kanamycin resistance reversion assay (Fig. 1f), we 
found that all improved cell viability (Fig. 2b). At the same time, three 
of the substitutions (M86L, R92A and R193A) maintained the fraction of 
kanamycin-resistant colonies comparable to the original G49D (P = 0.77, 
0.51 and 0.27, respectively, n = 3) (Fig. 2b), representing candidates for 
further use with append editing.
Viability was greatly enhanced across the single-substitution vari-
ants, yet DarT2 may still exert target-independent ADP-ribosylation 
that could have more subtle effects on cell growth and behavior. We, 
therefore, generated cells hypersensitive to ADP-ribosylation by delet-
ing the core repair gene recA to disable homologous recombination and 
assessed cell growth when expressing each ADPr-TAE variant under 
non-targeting conditions (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 2). While 
growth rates in the exponential phase were similar (Supplementary 
Fig. 2), we observed marked differences upon entry into the stationary 
phase. In particular, amino acid substitutions that previously com-
promised editing (M84L, R57A and R166A) yielded final turbidities 
paralleling the inactivating E170A (P = 0.35, 0.65 and 0.22, respectively, 
n = 3) (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 2). In contrast, substitutions that 
previously showed high editing efficiencies (M86L, R92A and R193A) 
exhibited a final turbidity similar to G49D alone (P = 0.99, 0.05 and 0.17, 
respectively, n = 3) and lower than E170A. We, therefore, combined the 
high-editing-efficiency substitutions (M86L, R92A and R193A) into a 
four-substitution version of DarT2, DarT2DLAA. This version maintained 
cell viability and a high frequency of kanamycin-resistant colonies 
(49%) in E. coli MG1655 (Fig. 2b). Moreover, in the recA-deletion (ΔrecA) 
strain, the append editor with DarT2DLAA restored final turbidity to 
approach that of the editor lacking ADP-ribosylation (E170A; P = 0.09, 
n = 3) (Fig. 2d).
By improving cell viability and growth in a strain in which 
homologous recombination was fully disabled, the append editor 
with DarT2DLAA afforded the opportunity to probe the genetic basis 
of templated-mediated editing. Prior work on the cytotoxicity of 
DarT2D in E. coli revealed a key role by RecF and possibly nucleotide 
excision repair17. However, the involved DNA repair pathways as part 
of targeted ADP-ribosylation with opposite-strand nicking could dif-
fer. Within the kanamycin reversion assay (Fig. 1f), recA was essential 
for editing and even showed some reduction in colony counts under 
non-targeting conditions (Fig. 2e). Disrupting the RecBCD branch of 
recombination (ΔrecB) reduced viability but also increased the fre-
quency of kanamycin-resistant colonies, suggesting a role in survival 
in the absence of recombination with the provided repair template. 
In contrast, disrupting the alternative RecFOR recombination path-
way (ΔrecF and ΔrecO) reduced editing relative to the WT (one-sided 
Welch's t-test, P = 0.048 and 0.001, respectively, n = 3) but not viability 
for recF (one-sided Welch's t-test, P = 0.40, n = 3), suggesting involve-
ment in templated recombination. Disrupting RecA-independent RecT 
recombination (ΔrecT) significantly reduced both viability and editing 
(one-sided Welch's t-test, P = 0.002 and 0.003, respectively, n = 3), 
suggesting involvement in both survival and templated recombina-

mismatch repair (ΔmutS), base excision repair (ΔxthA) and nucleotide 
excision repair (ΔuvrA) did not impact editing (one-sided Welch's

Welch's t-test, P = 0.87, 0.24 and 0.93, respectively, n = 3) relative to the 
WT. These findings implicate multiple recombination pathways as part 
of ADPr-TAE in E. coli.

Attenuated ADP-ribosylation enables flexible and 
noncytotoxic genome editing in bacteria
Append editing with DarT2DLAA efficiently reverted the premature 
stop codon in the kanamycin reversion assay. However, the reliance 
on homologous recombination lends to a much broader range of edits 
in different genes and bacteria. We, therefore, explored the bounds 
of ADPr-TA editing. For simplicity, editing was performed around the 
premature stop codon in the kanamycin reversion assay. When test-
ing edits beyond reversion of the stop codon, editing efficiency was 
determined without kanamycin selection by assessing the size of the 
target site or sequence of individual colonies.
Beginning with the homology arms, condensing their length from 
~500 to 100 bp reduced the frequency of kanamycin resistance from 
86% to 28%, whereas arm lengths of 50 bp and below exhibited virtually 
no kanamycin resistance (Supplementary Fig. 3). Continuing with 
~500-bp homology arms, we tested increasingly larger replacements, 
deletions and insertions (Fig. 2f-h). Replacements extending up to 
60 bp upstream or downstream of the target site or 91 bp spanning the 
target site were present in 80-100% and 50-75% of screened colonies, 
respectively, either as complete or partial conversions (Fig. 2g and 
Extended Data Fig. 4). Separately, deletions up to 91 bp were present 
in 90-100% of screened colonies, albeit with a high fraction of partial 
conversion with the largest deletion. Lastly, insertions of 10 bp and 
100 bp were present in 100% and 50-90% of screened colonies, respec-
tively. No colonies contained an insertion of 500 bp (Supplementary 
Fig. 4), indicating an upper limit to recombination. Editing was not 
limited to this target site in E. coli, as we could introduce substitutions 
at four additional targeted genes in E. coli (Extended Data Fig. 5a) and

insertions and deletions in bacteria without sacrificing viability.
Targeted ADP-ribosylation preferentially drives base 
mutagenesis in yeast and plants
Given that append editing drove templated recombination in bacteria, 
we asked whether eukaryotes would undergo similar editing outcomes. 
Beginning with the baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae cultured as 
a haploid, we transformed plasmids encoding the DarT2DLAA append 
editor, an sgRNA and a repair template with ~250-bp homology arms 
to introduce a premature stop codon as part of six substitutions in the 
FCY1 gene. Individual colonies were then screened on the basis of Sanger 
sequencing of the target site (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 6a,b). 
Append editing with DarT2DLAA-nScCas9 yielded templated edits in 
only 17% of the screened colonies, a reduced frequency compared 
to 50% generated via dsDNA breaks with ScCas9 (Fig. 3b). No edited 
colonies were obtained under non-targeting conditions or with DNA 
nicking alone, affirming the necessity of either dsDNA breaks or tar-
geted ADP-ribosylation for templated editing.
Beyond templated edits achieved with targeted ADP-ribosylation, 
we also observed a distinct set of edits in 25% of the screened colo-
nies: conversion of the ADP-ribosylated thymine into a different base 
(Fig. 3c and Extended Data Fig. 6a). These base substitutions principally 
occurred at the thymine expected to undergo ADP-ribosylation by 
DarT2, with the modified base becoming an A (67%) or a C (33%) (Fig. 3c). 
Such edits were absent with any of the other tested editors (Fig. 3c). 
Homologous recombination and base mutagenesis represented 
mutually exclusive repair outcomes, as removing the repair template 
enhanced the mutagenesis frequency without altering the location and 
distribution of mutations (Fig. 3c,d and Extended Data Fig. 6b). Base 
mutation was also observed when targeting sites within the genes ALP1 
and JSN1, albeit at lower frequencies (Supplementary Fig. 5a,b). Thus, 
in yeast, append editing drives either homology-directed repair (HDR) 
or mutagenesis of the ADP-ribosylated thymine.
The outcomes of append editing in yeast represented a major 
deviation from what we observed in tested bacteria and could reflect 
distinct editing outcomes in eukaryotes at large. However, in contrast 
to higher eukaryotes, S. cerevisiae engages in nonhomologous end 
joining less frequently and lacks poly(ADPr) polymerases involved in

dsDNA break repair that add and extend ADPr groups on DNA ends25,26. 
We, therefore, assessed the impact of ADPr-TAE in the model plant 
Nicotiana benthamiana. As a simple and fast assay, Agrobacterium 
constructs encoding the append editor were injected into N. bentha-
miana leaves, after which the type and frequency of edits were assessed 
by targeted amplicon sequencing of transfected tissues (Fig. 3e). In 
this setup, no repair template was included given the generally low 
frequencies of homologous recombination in this type of transfection 
assay in plants27. Additionally, the ScCas9 component of the append 
editor was exchanged for Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) to 
use available constructs.

was converted to the three other bases but with a bias toward A (59%) 
over C (19%) and G (22%). Testing two other target sites within PDS1, 
including one containing multiple DarT2 motifs, resulted in similar 
mutagenesis of the ADP-ribosylated T, with a bias toward A (Fig. 3g 
and Supplementary Fig. 6). Indels were observed under targeting 
conditions but at frequencies 6-80-fold lower than base mutagenesis 
(Supplementary Fig. 7). Thus, append editing can drive mutagenesis of 
the ADP-ribosylated base in both yeast and plants, reflecting distinct 
editing outcomes from those we observed in bacteria.
Targeted ADP-ribosylation drives base mutagenesis in human 
cells lacking TARG1
As a final but important branch of eukaryotes, we sought to explore 
append editing in human cells. Unlike S. cerevisiae and N. benthamiana, 
human cells possess an o-acyl-ADPr deacylase (OARD1), also known as 
TARG1, that was previously shown to reversibly remove the ADPr moiety 
appended to thymines by DarT2 (Fig. 4a)28. We, therefore, began by 
assessing ADPr-TAE in human cells with an intact or disrupted TARG1 
gene (Supplementary Fig. 8) using SpCas9 on the basis of available 
constructs. Plasmid constructs encoding an SpCas9-based editor and 
an sgRNA were transiently transfected into HEK293T cells and editing 
was assessed through next-generation sequencing of the target site 
in EMX1 without sorting or selection of transfected cells (Fig. 4b). An 
oligonucleotide repair template specifying a nine-base substitution 
and four-base deletion was included to evaluate both homologous 
recombination and base mutagenesis in parallel.
Using SpCas9 in HEK293T cells as a baseline, we observed match-
ing extents of templated edits (22%) and small indels (32%), with no 
significant difference in the absence of TARG1 (P = 0.99 and 0.94, 
respectively, n = 3) (Fig. 4c). Nicking similarly generated a high level 
of templated edits whether or not TARG1 was intact (18%) but with 
minimal small indels (0.4%) because of the lack of dsDNA breaks. The 
append editor with DarT2D also yielded templated edits, with the edit-
ing frequency increasing from 7% to 10% by disrupting TARG1. However, 
no significant differences were observed for append editors with the 
attenuated DarT2DLAA or with dDarT2 (P = 0.32 and 0.33, respectively, 
n = 3), suggesting that the templated edits were driven primarily 
through DNA nicking rather than DNA ADP-ribosylation.
At the same time, the ADPr-TA editor with DarT2D yielded 9% base 
substitutions specifically at the ADP-ribosylated thymine within two 
overlapping DarT2 recognition motifs, but only with TARG1 disrupted 
(Fig. 4c). Base substitutions were negligible with DarT2DLAA (0.2%) or 
dDarT2 (0.3%), suggesting that higher levels of ADP-ribosylation were 
necessary to drive editing (Fig. 4c). Indel frequencies for ADPr-TAE 
were slightly elevated over nCas9 with TARG1 disrupted (1.5% versus 
0.9%; P = 0.03, n = 3) but still 22-fold lower than that observed with 
Cas9 (33%) (Fig. 4c), indicating that the principal repair outcome of 
ADP-ribosylation and opposite-strand nicking is base mutagenesis. 
Thus, ADPr-TAE in HEK293T cells drives base mutagenesis similarly to 
what is observed in plants and yeast, but only in the absence of TARG1.
As different oligonucleotide templates revealed reduced tem-
plated repair with increased base mutagenesis (Supplementary Fig. 9), 
we repeated the editing assay without the oligonucleotide template. 
Base mutagenesis at both modified thymines increased to 16% (Fig. 4d), 
with conversion to either A or C at similar frequencies. Additionally, 
base mutagenesis was reduced 20-fold to 0.8% in the absence of 
DNA nicking, indicating the importance of the nick (Fig. 4d). We also 
observed a low frequency of deletions up to ~25 bp that were elevated 
with DNA nicking (Supplementary Fig. 10), paralleling observations 
with BEs29. Probing base mutagenesis beyond this target site, we per-
formed transient transfections without the oligonucleotide template 
at 16 additional target sites in five genes containing one or more DarT2 
recognition motifs (Fig. 4e and Supplementary Fig. 11). We observed 
measurable editing at all but two of these sites, with editing frequencies 
reaching up to 39% (Fig. 4e and Supplementary Fig. 11). Similar trends 
were observed in U2OS ∆TARG1 cells28, with generally lower editing fre-
quencies (up to 5.0%) likely because of lower transfection efficiencies 
(Extended Data Fig. 7a,b). We could also couple DarT2 with the nearly 
PAM-less SpRY variant of SpCas9 (ref. 30) to drive base substitutions 
through non-NGG PAMs (Extended Data Fig. 8).
Given the need to delete TARG1 to observe editing, we assessed 
the ability to transiently silence TARG1 expression to promote editing 
in WT HEK293T cells using RNA interference (Fig. 4f). Of three tested 
small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that each reduced TARG1 transcripts 
by at least 75% (Supplementary Fig. 12a), one siRNA yielded significant 
editing across all four tested target sites (Fig. 4g and Supplementary 
Fig. 12b). Editing was greatly diminished compared to that in cells lack-
ing TARG1 (for example, 39% in HEK293T ∆TARG1 versus 0.8% in WT cells 
with TARG1-siRNA at PTEN site 2), suggesting that residual TARG1 blocks 
editing with DarT2. Overall, these results show that append editing with

DarT2 principally drives substitution of the ADP-ribosylated base in 
human cells, with TARG1 posing a barrier to editing.
Targeted ADP-ribosylation mediates flexible, distinct and 
specific editing in mammalian cells
The expanded set of target sites allowed us to explore unique features 
of base mutagenesis. Across these sites, editing principally occurred 
at the modified thymine falling between positions 3 and 9 of sgRNA 
guide (Fig. 5a). For targets with multiple DarT2 recognition motifs, 
co-occurring mutations were observed 1.1-fold to 5.1-fold more fre-
quently than expected if the motifs could be edited independently (Sup-
plementary Fig. 13). Across these sites, we noticed distinct mutagenesis 
distributions that strongly depended on the DarT2 recognition motif 
(Fig. 5b). Specifically, 5′-TCTN-3′ motifs were associated with similar 
conversion frequencies to A and C. In contrast, 5′-TTTN-3′ were associ-
ated with a strong bias toward A, with secondary edits biased toward C 
(5′-TTTA-3′) or equally split between C and G (5′-TTTC-3′). We further 
assessed the frequency of small indels at selected target sites. Com-
pared to Cas9, the append editor resulted in 6-110-fold lower indel 
frequencies (Fig. 5c). Indel frequencies measured by next-generation 
sequencing or predicted using the Rule Set 2 scoring method31 at each 
target site with Cas9 correlated with base mutagenesis frequencies 
(Spearman correlation, ρ = 0.80 and 0.58, respectively) (Extended 
Data Fig. 9), indicating that indel formation with Cas9 offers a start-
ing point to identify efficient sites for append editing. Additionally, 
the append editor resulted in 3-21-fold fewer kilobase-scale deletions 
compared to Cas9, as detected through long-read sequencing (Fig. 5d 
and Supplementary Fig. 14)32.
Beyond unintended on-target edits, we also investigated 
guide-independent off-target effects knowing that errant DNA 
ADP-ribosylation could drive base substitution (Fig. 5e). As a point of 
comparison, we used the CBE BE4 previously demonstrated to intro-
duce cytosine base edits at orthogonal R-loops23. Creating orthogonal 
R-loops at each of five sites using the dead Cas9 from Staphylococcus 
aureus (dSaCas9), BE4 generated cytosine base substitutions signifi-
cantly more often than a no-editor control at two of the sites (Fig. 5e 
and Extended Data Fig. 10). Intriguingly, base substitutions in the 
R-loop were highest when BE4 was targeted ~650 bp upstream of the 
R-loop (Fig. 5e and Extended Data Fig. 10), suggesting enhanced fre-
quencies of sgRNA-independent editing in the vicinity of the target 
site. In contrast, the append editor did not result in any increase in 
base mutations at the thymine within the DarT2 motif across all five 
sites compared to the no-editor control. These results are in line with 
the need for opposite-strand nicking to drive append editing at the 
target site (Fig. 4d).
BEs using thymine glycosylases were recently reported33-35, raising 
the question how editing of the modified thymine compares between 
base excision and ADP-ribosylation. We, therefore, assessed editing 
outcomes at two target sites in HEK293T ∆TARG1 cells with our append 
editor and the deaminase-free (DAF) thymine BE (TBE) as a representa-
tive example (Fig. 5f)33. DAF-TBE edited multiple thymines within the 
target, with the most efficient editing at position 5 of the sgRNA guide. 
The append editor edited only the thymine in the recognized motif, 
with higher editing than any single thymine with DAF-TBE at both 
sites (P = 0.0001 and 0.052). Interestingly, the editing profiles were 
distinct, with the DAF-TBE predominantly yielding T-to-C or T-to-S 
edits33 compared to predominantly T-to-A or T-to-M edits using append 
editing. Both editors exhibited similarly low levels of indel formation 
and large deletions (Supplementary Figs. 15 and 16). These results 
show that ADP-ribosylation and base excision of thymine drive distinct 
editing outcomes.
Discussion
In this work, we explored the impact of appending chemical moieties to 
target DNA as a distinct yet broad approach for precision editing, what 
we call append editing. As a first example, we used the bacterial toxin 
DarT2 to mediate ADPr-TAE. When paired with opposite-strand nicking, 
ADPr-TAE introduced precise edits through homologous recombina-
tion in tested bacteria, allowing the creation of templated edits (Fig. 6). 
While this strategy also drove templated recombination in yeast, the 
predominant outcome was mutagenesis of the ADP-ribosylated thy-
mine. Base mutagenesis was similarly observed in plants and mam-
malian cells, with a general bias toward substitution to A or C (Fig. 6). 
Although the exact underlying repair pathways in eukaryotes remain 
to be identified (for example, nucleotide excision repair or translesion 
synthesis), homologous recombination can at least be excluded. This 
divergence in repair pathways contrasts with other genome-editing 
approaches that engage equivalent repair pathways across organisms 
and result in similar types of edits, supporting append editing as a 
distinct entry in the genome-editing toolbox.
Furthermore, ADPr-TAE offers unique opportunities for genome 
editing in bacteria (Fig. 6) exemplified by the broad range of gener-
ated sequence replacements, deletions and insertions. This form 
of editing did not sacrifice colony counts compared to traditional 
dsDNA cleavage36, offered broader edits without perturbing DNA repair 
compared to prime editing37,38 and omitted fixed scars compared to 
CRISPR-associated transposons39. Given these distinctions, ADPr-TAE is 
well suited for generating large chromosomal libraries and multiplexed 
editing or multibase editing in nonmodel bacteria40.
In yeast, plant and human cells, ADPr-TAE operates closest to BEs 
yet offers distinct editing avenues. BEs to date rely on base deami-
nases or glycosylases that convert T (or A on the opposite strand) 
into C (adenosine deaminase)18, G (adenine glycosylase)41 or C/G 
(thymine glycosylase), with extensive bystander editing33-35,42. In con-
trast, ADPr-TAE converts T to A or A/C depending on the organism 
and sequence context, with minimal bystander edits. T-to-A editing is 
particularly unique, where ADPr-TAE could potentially revert 789 of 
the verified pathogenic single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) across 355 
genes in the ClinVar database43 otherwise off-limits through existing 
TBEs. While the current DarT2 recognition motif would capture a 
fraction of these SNVs (that is, 30 T-to-A and 447 T-to-C mutations) 
(Supplementary Table 3), relaxing the motif through ortholog mining 
or protein engineering could access a greater set. A stringent motif 
can also be beneficial, such as when reversing pathogenic mutations 
susceptible to bystander edits. In particular, ADPr-TAE could create a 
single desired T-to-C edit in a stretch of three thymines (for example, 
pathogenic mutation in the third T of 5′-TTTG-3′ (c.103C>T, c.4396C>T, 
c.4852C>T, c.5188C>T, c.5623C>T, c.742C>T and c.748C>T) or 5′-TTTA-3′ 
(c.1537C>T, c.3346C>T, c.3673C>T, c.3826C>T, c.4603C>T, c.5473C>T 
and c.5599C>T) in the ATM gene underlying ataxia telangiectasia44), 
while current adenine BEs (ABEs) would generate unwanted edits 
across the thymines. TARG1 poses an immediate barrier to ADPr-TAE in 
human cells; while we marginally circumvented TARG1 using transient 
gene silencing with RNA interference45, more potent approaches such 
as the development of specific peptide or chemical inhibitors46 or 
dominant-negative mutants such as those used to inhibit mismatch 
repair47 may be required.
Beyond ADP-ribosylation of thymine with DarT2, a large num-
ber of base-modifying enzymatic domains against any of the four 
nucleotides could expand append editing. For instance, DarT1 tox-
ins (related to DarT2) and eukaryotic toxins called pierisins (found 
in cabbage moths) ADP-ribosylate the N2 position of guanine48,49, 
with evidence of base mutagenesis by pierisins in Chinese hamster 
ovary cells50. Additionally, bacteria and bacteriophages append 
unique chemical moieties such as methylcarbamoyl51, dPreQ0  
(ref. 52), dADG53, glucosyl-5-hydroxymethyl54 and 5-hydroxymethyl55 
to their DNA to block access by antiphage defenses56. The associated 
enzymatic domains could be further engineered to alter the modified 
nucleotide, the recognized motif or the appended moiety and enhance 
editing efficiencies. Interestingly, these examples consistently derive

from host-pathogen or host-parasite interactions that could serve as 
a plentiful source of such base-modifying domains.
Lastly, apart from genome editing, appending chemical moieties 
to DNA in a targeted manner could facilitate the study of localized ver-
sus genome-wide DNA repair. Evaluating the impact of DNA adducts is 
central to elucidating responsible modes of repair potentially driving 
mutagenesis and carcinogenesis. To date, introducing such adducts 
at specific chromosomal sites has proven extremely difficult and 
laborious57. With append editing, specific adducts could be studied 
in real time58 or in conjunction with genome-wide screening of repair 
pathways59, thus uncovering the molecular basis of editing outcomes 
and probable strategies to shape these outcomes.

Methods
Polymerase-blocking assays
WT and inactivated (E170A) EPEC DarT2 proteins were expressed using 
the cell-free myTXTL master mix (Arbor Biosciences). Linear DarT 
expression templates were amplified from plasmids or ordered as 
synthetic gene fragments (Integrated DNA Technologies) and con-
tained a T7 promoter and a T7 terminator (Supplementary Table 2). 
Cell-free expression was performed in 12-µl reactions, comprising 9 µl 
of myTXTL master mix, 4 nM of EPEC DarT2 template, 0.4 nM of a T7 
RNA polymerase-encoding plasmid and 4 µM of the RecBCD inhibitor 
GamS to prevent degradation of the linear DNA templates. The reac-
tions were incubated for 16 h at 29 °C.
For ADP-ribosylation of ssDNA templates, the ADP-ribosylation 
assay was adapted from prior work with slight alterations13. Briefly, 5 µl 
of the TXTL reaction mix was incubated with 10 µM of the ssDNA oligo, 
50 µM NAD+, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA and ster-
ile nuclease-free water to reach a final volume of 20 µl and incubated 
for 30 min at 30 °C. Afterward, the oligos were separated from the mix 
using the Oligo clean and concentrator kit (Zymo).
To assess whether DNA ADP-ribosylation blocks DNA poly-
merases in vitro, the DarT-treated oligos were first annealed to the  
5′ 6-Fam-tagged primer CKo20 at a final concentration of 10 µM in  
1× NEBuffer 2 by heating the mixture to 94 °C and gradually cooling it to 
room temperature. Next, 2 µl of the annealed product was mixed with 
0.5 U of Klenow fragment (New England Biolabs), 33 µM dNTPs and  
1× NEBuffer 2 in a total volume of 12.5 µl and incubated for 15 min at 
37 °C. To stop the reaction, EDTA was added to a final concentration of 
10 mM and the samples were incubated at 75 °C for 20 min.
To visualize the block of polymerization, 4 µl of the polymerization 
product was mixed with 4 µl of loading dye (containing 95% formamide, 
0.03% SDS, 18 mM EDTA, 23 µM xylene cyanol and 19 µM bromophenol 
blue) and loaded onto a preheated denaturing polyacrylamide gel 
(8 M urea and 20% polyacrylamide (19:1)). The gel was run at 250 V for 
30 min and visualized under ultraviolet light before and after staining 
with SYBR gold (Thermo Fisher).
Microbial strains, handling and growth conditions
All bacterial and yeast strains used in this study are listed in Supple-
mentary Table 2. Unless otherwise specified, E. coli TOP10 was used 
for plasmid cloning and propagation and was grown at 37 °C in Luria-
Bertani (LB) liquid medium (10 g L−1 tryptone, 5 g L−1 yeast extract and 
10 g L−1 NaCl) shaking orbitally at 200 rpm or on LB solid medium 
(15 g L−1 agar) at 37 °C, containing kanamycin (50 mg L−1), carbenicillin 
(100 mg L−1) or chloramphenicol (34 mg L−1), when appropriate. The 
E. coli kanR* strain (CBS-4802) began as strain CB330 (E. coli MG1655 
PJ23110-araFGH ∆araBAD), selected for uniform arabinose induction, 
to which two chromosomal modifications were made. First, the ∆lacZ 
phenotype (W519*) was generated by CBE-mediated deamination 
of 5′-ACC-3′ to 5′-ATT-3′ (positions 364,749 and 364,750 in MG1655), 
resulting in a premature stop codon; this edit was not used in this work. 
Second, a defective kanR expression construct (kanR*) (annotated 
sequence of the genomic locus in Supplementary Table 2) containing a 
premature stop codon (Q177*) and DarT2 motif 5′-TTTC-3′ was inserted 
between genes ybjM and grxA (positions 890,463-890,480 in MG1655) 
by Red-mediated recombination with Cas9 counterselection1,36,65. The 
resulting E. coli MG1655 kanR* strain was used for all assays related to 
the kanR* gene. The kanR* strain was further used to generate ΔrecA, 
ΔrecB, ΔrecF, ΔrecT, ΔrecJ, ΔrecO, ΔxthA, ΔmutS and ΔuvrA mutants 
by Red-mediated recombination66. Briefly, transformants of the E. coli 
kanR* strain carrying pKD46 (encoding λ Red-γ, Red-β and Red-exo) 
were cultured in l-arabinose at 30 °C until an optical density at 600 nm 
(OD600) of ~0.6, made electrocompetent as previously described66 
and then transformed with a linear dsDNA template containing 40-nt 
homology arms to mediate deletion of the target gene. Next, pKD46 
was cured from the bacteria by growing them at 37 °C, after which the 
bacteria were made electrocompetent and transformed with pCP20 
and then grown at 42 °C to simultaneously express FLP recombinase 
and eliminate pCP20. Colonies were then screened for gene deletion 
by colony PCR and Sanger sequencing. For the substitution assays 
targeting the aaaD, punR, ygcQ and yheO genes, the E. coli MG1655 
strain was used.
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium strain 
LT2 was used for all ADPr-TAE assays in Salmonella and was regularly 
grown at 37 °C in LB liquid medium shaking orbitally at 200 rpm or 
on solid LB medium. Carbenicillin (100 mg L−1) and chloramphenicol 
(34 mg L−1) were supplemented in the growth medium when necessary.
The S. cerevisiae BY4741 (Δtrp1, Δleu2) strain was used for all yeast 
experiments. Unless otherwise specified, S. cerevisiae was grown in non-
selective liquid YPD medium (20 g L−1 peptone, 10 g L−1 yeast extract and 
2% (w/v) d(+)-glucose) or on solid nonselective YPD medium (20 g L−1 
agar). To select for transformants, S. cerevisiae cells were grown on 
solid synthetic defined (SD) medium without tryptophan and leucine, 
containing 6.9 g L−1 yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Forme-
dium, CYN0402), 0.64 g L−1 complete supplement mixture without 
tryptophan and leucine (Formedium, DCS0569), 20 g L−1 d(+)-galactose 
(Sigma-Aldrich, 15522-250G-R) and 20 g L−1 agar (Th. Geyer, 214510).
Plasmid construction
Annotated sequences of all plasmids used in this study are provided 
in Supplementary Table 2. Unless otherwise specified, general cloning 
methods such as KLD (KLD enzyme mix, M0554S) or Gibson assem-
bly (NEBuilder HiFi DNA assembly master mix, E2621X) were used 
to assemble linear dsDNA fragments into plasmids. Linear dsDNA 
fragments were amplified with Q5 high-fidelity 2× master mix (New 
England Biolabs, M0492L) and purified using the NucleoSpin gel and 
PCR cleanup kit (Macherey-Nagel, 740609.50). Plasmid sequences 
were verified by full plasmid sequencing (Plasmidsaurus) or Sanger 
sequencing (Microsynth Seqlab).
To generate the append editors expressed in plants, the codon- 
optimized DNA sequence for DarT2D was commercially synthesized 
(Twist Bioscience) with a previously reported N7-NLS for expression 
in N. benthamiana67, while the zCas9i (Zea mays codon-optimized 
Cas9 coding sequence with 13 introns) was obtained from Addgene 
(kit 1000000171)68. Both fragments were amplified using the iProof 
high-fidelity PCR kit (Bio-Rad, 1725331). The dDarT, nzCas9i and dzCas9i 
variants were generated using inverse PCR. Three gRNAs targeting the 
phytoene desaturase 1 gene (PDS1) (Supplementary Table 2) were cloned 
by annealing complementary oligos into an AtU6 gRNA cassette. Gene 
fragments were assembled using the GoldenBraid cloning strategy69.
kanR* reversion
To assess ADPr-TAE in E. coli, an overnight culture of strain CBS-4802 
was backdiluted 100-fold, grown to an OD600 of 0.6-0.8 and then ren-
dered electrocompetent in 10% glycerol. For transformation, 40 μl 
of electrocompetent cells were mixed with 9 fmol of the relevant 
plasmid(s) and transferred to an ice cold 1-mm electroporation cuvette 
(Bio-Rad Laboratories, 1652089). Cells were electroporated using the 
GenePulser Xcell microbial system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, 1652662) 
and the following settings: 1.8 kV, 25 µF and 200 Ω. Next, cells were 
supplemented with 500 μl of SOC medium (5 g L−1 yeast extract, 20 g L−1 
tryptone, 0.584 g L−1 NaCl, 0.186 g L−1 KCl, 2.4 g L−1 MgSO4 and 20 mM 
glucose) and recovered for 1 h at 37 °C, shaking orbitally at 200 rpm. 
Cells were collected by centrifugation at 3,000g, the supernatant was 
decanted and cells were resuspended in 2 ml of induction medium 
(LB, l-arabinose (0.2% w/v), carbenicillin (100 mg L−1) and chloram-
phenicol (34 mg L−1)) and incubated at 37 °C for 16 h, shaking orbitally 
at 200 rpm. Afterward, cell cultures were serially diluted in five tenfold 
steps in LB, from which 3 μl of each dilution was spotted on LB solid 
medium containing either carbenicillin and chloramphenicol to select 
for transformed cells or carbenicillin, chloramphenicol and kanamycin

to select for transformed and edited cells. The spotted LB solid medium 
was then incubated for 16 h at 37 °C followed by counting colonies.
Replacement, deletion and insertion assays in E. coli
For the E. coli replacement, deletion and insertion assays at the kanR* 
locus and the substitution assays at the aaaD, punR, ygcQ and yheO 
genes, an identical transformation and selection protocol was used 
as described above. However, after the 16-h incubation in the induc-
tion medium, 100 μl of the cell culture was plated on LB solid medium 
containing carbenicillin and chloramphenicol to obtain single colonies. 
Single colonies were resuspended in Q5 high-fidelity 2× master mix 
containing the appropriate primers and subjected to PCR amplifica-
tion following the instructions of the manufacturer and extending the 
initial heating step of 98 °C to 5 min to mediate cell lysis and release 
of genomic DNA. Amplicons were purified and sequenced through 
Sanger sequencing.
Growth-based toxicity assay in E. coli
The growth-based toxicity assay began by rendering strain CBS-5301 
electrocompetent. Next, 9 fmol of plasmid CBS-4808 was transformed 
into strain CBS-5301 using the electroporation conditions described 
above. Transformants were recovered in 500 µl of SOC medium for 1 h 
at 37 °C, shaking orbitally at 200 rpm, then plated on LB solid medium 
supplemented with carbenicillin and incubated for 16 h at 37 °C. Next, 
a single colony was inoculated into 2 ml of LB medium containing 
carbenicillin, grown until an OD600 of 0.6 and then made electrocom-
petent following the protocols described above. A second round of 
transformation was performed, using one of nine different editor 
plasmids (CBS-6738, CBS-6739, CBS-6741, CBS-6742, CBS-6743, CBS-
6744, CBS-6745, CBS-4781 or CBS-4800), following the electroporation 
protocol described above. Transformed cells were allowed to recover 
in 500 µl of SOC medium for 1 h at 37 °C shaking orbitally at 200 rpm, 
plated on LB solid medium supplemented with carbenicillin, chloram-
phenicol and glucose (20 mM) and incubated for 16 h at 37 °C. Three 
individual colonies from each of the nine resulting strains (Supplemen-
tary Table 2) were then used to inoculate a 96-deep-well plate (Greiner 
Bio-One, 780271), containing 400 µl of LB medium supplemented with 
carbenicillin, chloramphenicol and glucose (20 mM) and covered with 
an adhesive gas-permeable membrane (Thermo Scientific, 241205). 
After incubating the deep-well plate for 16 h at 37 °C, the cell cultures 
were adjusted to an OD600 of 0.1 using LB supplemented with carbenicil-
lin, chloramphenicol and l-arabinose (0.2% w/v) in a new 96-well plate, 
reaching a final volume of 200 µl. The 96-well plate was then measured 
every 3 min over 12 h at 37 °C for absorbance at 600 nm on a BioTek 
Synergy Neo2 plate reader, shaking at 500 rpm.
Nonselective editing at kanR*
Transformations were performed as described above; however, after 
the 16-h incubation in induction medium, the cultures were centri-
fuged, the medium was discarded and genomic DNA was isolated using 
the Wizard gDNA purification kit (Promega, A1120). The kanR site was 
then amplified through PCR using the primer pair HBo-314 and HBo-315 
and the Q5 high-fidelity 2× master mix for 25 cycles. Resulting ampli-
cons were sequenced with Nanopore sequencing (Eurofins Genomics). 
For data analysis, FASTQ sequencing data files were aligned to a FASTA 
file of the unedited amplicon using MiniMap2 with option 'map-ont'70. 
SAMtools was used to convert the SAM files into BAM files, while con-
currently sorting and indexing71. All further analysis was performed 
using R, after calling libraries tidyverse and GenomicAlignments72. A 
function was defined to take BAM files as an argument and then extract 
all alleles aligned to the 8-nt region of the templated edit as a list of 
characters. This function was applied to all BAM files to generate lists 
of alleles, which were tallied and compiled into a single data frame 
in long table format. Next, alleles were defined as unedited, edited 
or ambiguous and the fraction of each observation was computed. 
Samples were then grouped by editor and repair plasmids, after which 
the mean and s.d. were computed and then used to generate the bar 
plot. Further analysis was undertaken to search for base mutations at 
the ADPr site. The list of alleles in the initial data frame was filtered to 
retain only records containing a T-to-V mutation at the ADPr target 
position but otherwise matching the reference allele. Records were 
grouped by sample and SNVs were tallied, after which each was divided 
by the total number of observed alleles and multiplied by 100 to obtain 
the percentage of base mutations amongst all sequencing reads.
Whole-genome off-target assay in E. coli
For identifying whole-genome off-target mutations, strain CBS-4802 
was grown from a single colony in LB medium and made electrocom-
petent as described above. Electrocompetent CBS-4802 was then 
cotransformed with equimolar amounts (9 fmol) of CBS-6746 and 
one of several editor plasmids (CBS-3130, CBS-6738 or CBS-6740). 
Transformants were recovered in 500 μl of SOC for 1 h at 37 °C shaking 
orbitally at 200 rpm, after which the growth medium was replaced with 
2 ml of LB, supplemented with carbenicillin, chloramphenicol and 
l-arabinose (0.2%), followed by incubation at 37 °C for 16 h shaking 
orbitally at 200 rpm. Next, the cultures were streaked onto LB solid 
medium supplemented with carbenicillin and chloramphenicol and 
incubated for 16 h at 37 °C to obtain individual colonies. Three colonies 
from each condition were placed in 2 ml of LB medium supplemented 
with carbenicillin and chloramphenicol and cultured for 16 h at 37 °C.
After incubation, cultures were centrifuged and the cell pellets 
were subjected to genomic DNA isolation using the Wizard genomic 
DNA purification kit. Isolated genomic DNA was fully sequenced using 
Nanopore sequencing (Plasmidsaurus). For data analysis, FASTQ 
sequencing data files were aligned to a FASTA file of E. coli MG1655 
(GenBank: U00096.3) using Minimap2 with the 'map-ont' option70. 
SAMtools was used to convert the SAM files into BAM files, while 
concurrently sorting and indexing71. Clair3 was run on the GalaxyEU 
server to call variants73,74. Bcftools was used to query the VCF files for 
POS, REF, ALT, DP and AF fields and export the results into a CSV file75. 
The sequencing depth at all positions in all BAM files was calculated 
by SAMtools and exported as a CSV file. All further analysis was per-
formed in R after loading library tidyverse72. CSV files were loaded into 
a long-format data frame. This data frame was then filtered as follows: 
(1) SNVs were retained by filtering for records that contain only a single 
character in the REF and ALT fields; (2) SNVs already present in the par-
ent strain were eliminated by filtering for records containing POS field 
values not found in parent strain POS field values; (3) SNVs mapped 
to regions known to have been modified during the creation of strain 
CBS-4802 were eliminated by filtering for records with POS field values 
not present in said regions; (4) records were filtered for AF field values 
greater than or equal to 0.25; (5) SNVs observed at a sequencing depth 
greater than or equal to the lowest quartile of all BAM files (Q1 ≥ 34) 
were retained; and (6) all SNVs were recoded to C > D and T > V, tallied 
and then used to generate a heat map.
Editing assays in S. enterica
Electrocompetent S. enterica cells were transformed with 9 fmol of 
plasmid CBS-4800 and recovered in 500 μl of SOC medium following 
an identical protocol to that described above for E. coli. After recovery, 
the cells were collected through centrifugation at 3,000g, the superna-
tant was decanted and the cell pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of LB 
medium. The cell suspension was plated on LB solid medium contain-
ing chloramphenicol (34 mg L−1) and incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. After 
incubation, a single colony was selected and used to create electro-
competent S. enterica cells harboring plasmid CBS-4800 following the 
protocol described above. Then, 22 fmol of the plasmids containing 
the repair template and the T sgRNA (Supplementary Table 2) were 
transformed in triplicate through electroporation into S. enterica 
cells harboring plasmid CBS-4800. The cells were recovered in 500 μl

of SOC medium and collected through centrifugation at 3,000g, the 
supernatant was decanted and the cell pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of 
induction medium (LB, 0.2% (w/v) l-arabinose, 100 mg L−1 carbenicillin 
and 34 mg L−1 chloramphenicol) and grown at 37 °C for 16 h, shaking 
orbitally at 200 rpm. Next, 100 μl of the cell culture was plated on LB 
solid medium containing carbenicillin and chloramphenicol to obtain 
single colonies. Colonies were resuspended in Q5 high-fidelity 2× mas-
ter mix containing the appropriate primers and subjected to PCR ampli-
fication following the instructions of the manufacturer and adding an 
initial heating step of 98 °C for 5 min to mediate cell lysis and release 
of genomic DNA. Amplicons were then purified using the NucleoSpin 
gel and PCR cleanup kit and sequenced through Sanger sequencing.
Templated editing assays in S. cerevisiae
S. cerevisiae BY4741 (Δtrp1, Δleu2) cells were cotransformed with two 
plasmids, one bearing the specified editor variant and the other bear-
ing a 6-bp substitution template flanked by 294-bp (upstream) and 
232-bp (downstream) homology arms along with an FCY1 T sgRNA 
or NT sgRNA (Supplementary Table 2), following the lithium acetate 
method as previously described76.
Briefly, single S. cerevisiae colonies were inoculated into 2 ml of 
liquid YPD medium (20 g L−1 peptone, 10 g L−1 yeast extract and 2% 
(w/v) d(+)-glucose) and grown for 16 h at 30 °C, shaking at 200 rpm 
on a rotary shaker. The cells were diluted to an OD600 of 0.5 in 50 ml of 
YPD medium and cultured again at 30 °C, shaking at 200 rpm, until the 
cells reached an OD600 of 2. The cells were then harvested by centrifuga-
tion at 3,000g for 5 min, the supernatant was decanted and the pellet 
was resuspended in 25 mL of sterile water. The centrifugation and 
resuspension step was repeated followed by another centrifugation 
at 3,000g for 5 min and resuspension in 1 ml of sterile water. The cell 
suspension was then centrifuged for 30 s at 13,000g, the supernatant 
was discarded and the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of sterile water. 
Next, 100-μl aliquots were distributed in 1.5-ml sterile Eppendorf tubes 
and the cells were collected by centrifugation at 13,000g for 30 s. The 
supernatant was decanted and the cell pellet was resuspended with 
326 μl of transformation mix (240 μl of PEG 3350, 36 μl of 1 M lithium 
acetate and 50 μl of 2 mg ml−1 carrier ssDNA), plasmid DNA (500 ng 
of each plasmid) and sterile water to reach a final volume of 360 μl. 
The suspension was incubated at 42 °C for 40 min, after which it was 
centrifuged at 13,000g for 30 s. The supernatant was decanted, the cell 
pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of YPD medium and the cell suspension 
was incubated for 3 h at 30 °C. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 
13,000g for 30 s and washed twice with 1 ml of SD medium to remove 
any residual YPD medium. Finally, the cell pellet was resuspended with 
100 μl of SD medium, plated on solid SD medium without tryptophan 
and leucine and containing d-galactose and incubated at 30 °C for 
3 days or until colonies were visible.
Resulting colonies were collected with a sterile 10-μl pipette tip 
and resuspended in 10 μl of sterile 0.02 M NaOH, boiled at 99 °C for 
10 min and centrifuged for 10 s at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge. 
Then, 1 μl of the supernatant was used as template for PCR using the 
Q5 high-fidelity 2× master mix and the primer pair prCP222-prCP223 
to amplify FCY1 (Supplementary Table 2). The resulting PCR product 
was purified using the NucleoSpin gel and PCR cleanup kit, following 
the manufacturer's instructions. The final product was sequenced 
through Sanger sequencing. Sequence alignment was performed using 
the online MAFFT algorithm77.
Base mutation assays in S. cerevisiae
S. cerevisiae BY4741 (Δtrp1, Δleu2) cells were cotransformed with 
two plasmids, one bearing the specified editor variant and the other 
bearing either of the T sgRNAs for FCY1, ALP1 or JSN1 or an NT sgRNA 
(Supplementary Table 2), following identical procedures to those 
described above. Resulting colonies were screened through colony 
PCR as described above and the primer pairs prCP222-prCP223, 
prCP445-prCP446 and prCP441-prCP442 were used to amplify FCY1, 
ALP1 and JSN1, respectively (Supplementary Table 2). The resulting PCR 
products were sequenced through Sanger sequencing and sequence 
alignment was performed using the MAFFT algorithm77.
Base mutation assays in N. benthamiana
N. benthamiana seeds were germinated in soil and transplanted at the 
1-week-old stage to 24 cell nursery flats, one plant per cell, and grown 
at 23 °C under a 16-h light and 8-h dark cycle in Sungro horticulture 
professional grow mix mixed 1:1 with Jolly gardener Pro-line C/B grow-
ing mix (Sungro).
Plasmids were used to electroporate Agrobacterium tumefaciens 
strain GV3101 using Bio-Rad GenePulser electroporator with the follow-
ing conditions: 1.8 kV, 100 Ω and 25 µF. Single colonies were inoculated 
in LB medium containing spectinomycin (100 µg ml−1), rifampicin 
(50 µg ml−1) and gentamicin (50 µg ml−1) for 16 h at 28 °C with orbital 
shaking at 200 rpm. Cultures were then centrifuged and resuspended 
in infiltration medium (10 mM MgCl2 and 100 µM acetosyringone) to 
reach an OD600 of ~0.1. Next, the resuspended cultures were combined 
in a 1:1 ratio with an A. tumefaciens strain containing p19 (a suppressor 
of gene silencing) and were infiltrated into the leaves of 4-week-old 
plants using a 1-ml needleless syringe. The infiltrated plants were then 
recovered overnight in the dark and grown for 7 days using the condi-
tions mentioned above.
Next-generation sequencing in N. benthamiana
Leaf tissues were isolated 7 days after infiltration using a standard 
hole punch and collected in 1.5-ml tubes containing ~100 µl of 1 mm 
glass beads. Disks from four leaves (one disk per leaf) were pooled to 
create each biological replicate. The samples were frozen at −80 °C 
for 24 h, after which the tissue was ground using a Vivadent shaker 
for 5 s followed by resuspension in CTAB buffer (1.4 M NaCl, 20 mM 
EDTA pH 8, 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8 and 3% CTAB). Cellular DNA was 
then extracted using chloroform and isopropyl alcohol followed by 
a 70% ethanol wash.
The targeted region was amplified with optimized primers and 
PCR conditions, using an iProof high-fidelity PCR kit. The products were 
purified using 4 µl of ExoSAP-IT PCR product cleanup reagent (Applied 
Biosystems, A55242) at 37 °C for 15 min followed by inactivation at 
80 °C for 15 min. A second amplification was performed with iProof 
polymerases to introduce unique Illumina barcodes and libraries were 
purified using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen).
The concentration for each library was measured using Qubit 
fluorometer (Invitrogen) and equimolar amounts were pooled along 
with the 120 pM phiX control library corresponding to 8% of the final 
volume. Then, 20 μl of the pooled library was loaded into the iSeq 100 
(Illumina) and the run was performed in accordance with iSeq 100 
sequencing system guide. Sequencing data analysis was performed 
as mentioned for mammalian cells.
Mammalian cell culture and transfection
HEK293T cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Col-
lection (CRL 11268) and U2OSΔTARG1 cell lines were a gift from the I. Ahel 
lab. Unless otherwise mentioned, all cell lines were maintained using 
DMEM (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS (Corning 
and BANF Biotrend), 1× penicillin-streptomycin (Life Technologies) 
and 2 mM l-glutamine. The cultures were incubated in humidified 
incubators at 37 °C with 5% CO2.
For generating the HEK293T ΔTARG1 cell line, cells were trans-
fected with plasmids containing WT SpCas9 and TARG1 sgRNA28 
(Supplementary Table 2) using Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen, 
L3000008) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Then, 48 h 
after transfection, cells were diluted and seeded in 96-well plates at a 
density of three cells per well. Colonies were observed after 7 days and 
wells with single colonies were selected. Selected clones were tested

for TARG1 site disruption through Sanger sequencing followed by west-
ern blotting (Supplementary Fig. 8) with anti-TARG1 antibody (Fisher 
Scientific, 25249-1-AP)28 and anti-β-actin antibody (Life Technologies, 
MA5-15739-HRP) as the housekeeping control.
For templated editing assays in HEK293T (WT and ΔTARG1) cell 
line, 65,000 cells per well were seeded onto tissue-culture-treated 
24-well plates (Corning) and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 under 
humidified conditions. Then, 24 h later, 50 fmol of each plasmid was 
cotransfected with 750 fmol of single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide 
repair templates using 1.12 μl of Lipofectamine 3000 reagent and 1 μl 
of P3000. For base mutagenesis assays, 500 ng of each plasmid was 
transfected, following the same conditions as mentioned above. The 
medium was refreshed 24 h after transfection and cells were collected 
72 h after transfection.
For base mutagenesis assays in the U2OSΔTARG1 cell line, 1.3 × 105 cells 
were seeded and 1 μg of plasmid DNA, 1.5 μl of Lipofectamine 3000 
reagent and 2 μl of P3000 were used for transfection. Medium change 
and sample collection were performed similarly to HEK293T cells.
For orthogonal R-loop assays in HEK293TΔTARG1 cell lines, 65,000 
cells were seeded per well in 24-well plates and cotransfected after 
24 h with 300 ng of SpCas9-based editor plasmids, 200 ng of SpCas9 
guide plasmid, 300 ng of dSaCas9 plasmid (Addgene, 138162) and 
200 ng of SaCas9 guide plasmid. Then, 1.5 µl of Lipofectamine 3000 
and 2 µl of P3000 reagent were used for transfection; cell pellets were 
collected after 72 h.
RNA interference
For the RNA interference experiments, Dicer-substrate siRNAs were 
designed and purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (TriFECTa 
RNAi Kit, design ID: hs.Ri.OARD1.13). All siRNA transfections were 
performed in HEK293T cells using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitro-
gen, 13778075) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A total 
of 80,000 cells were seeded per well in tissue-culture-treated 24-well 
plates (Corning) and forward-transfected with 10 nM siRNA. After 48 h, 
500 ng of each plasmid was transfected under the same conditions 
as described above. The medium was refreshed 24 h after plasmid 
transfection and cells were harvested 72 h after plasmid transfection.
The knockdown efficiency of TARG1 expression was assessed at the 
transcript level by real-time qPCR. Briefly, 80,000 cells were seeded 
and transfected with 10 nM siRNA and total RNA was extracted after 
72 h using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's 
protocol. RNA (500 ng) was used for one-step real-time qPCR using the 
iTaq Universal SYBR green one-step kit (Bio-Rad, 172-5151) on a CFX96 
real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad). The thermal cycling condi-
tions were as follows: 50 °C for 10 min (reverse transcription), 95 °C for 
1 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s and 60 °C for 30 s and a 
final melt curve analysis. The following primers were used for real-time 
qPCR: TARG1 forward, 5′-AAAGGAGACCTTTTTGCAT-3′; TARG1 reverse, 
5′-GATTTAAAAGTTCTTGCACCC-3′. For each biological replicate, 
mRNA levels were quantified using the ΔΔCt method, with normaliza-
tion to HPRT expression and comparison to the corresponding NT 
siRNA control. Final values represent the mean relative expression 
across biological replicates.
Next-generation sequencing for mammalian cells
Genomic DNA was isolated from harvested cells using PureLink 
genomic DNA mini kit (Life Technologies, K182002). Specific primers 
were used to amplify the targeted region using Q5 high-fidelity 2× 
master mix through 27 cycles. The PCR product was purified using the 
NucleoSpin gel and PCR cleanup kit and was used as a template in KAPA 
HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (Roche Diagnostics, KK2602) to introduce Illu-
mina adaptor sequences within 15 PCR cycles. The KAPA-PCR products 
were cleaned using Agencourt AMPure XP magnetic beads (Beckman 
Coulter, A63881) and 200 ng of this product was used as template for 
a second PCR with KAPA ReadyMix to introduce Illumina barcodes 
through ten PCR cycles followed by cleanup using magnetic beads as 
mentioned before. PCR products were screened at each step for correct 
fragment length using agarose gel electrophoresis. The libraries were 
pooled in equimolar amounts and at least 1 million reads were gener-
ated for each sample using NovaSeq 6000 and NextSeq 2000. The 
demultiplexed data were analyzed using CRISPResso2 (ref. 78). Default 
parameters were used to perform the analysis except when quantifying 
indel and HDR frequencies for templated editing, in which case a plot 
window size of 30 was used. Allelle_frequency_table_around_sgRNA.
txt files generated by CRISPResso2 were used within R scripts (https:// 
github.com/saliba-lab/ADPr_TAE_analysis) to further quantify base 
mutation frequencies as the total percentage of reads containing a 
nucleotide different from the reference read.
Nanopore sequencing
The following steps were carried out in an amplicon-free pre-PCR area. 
First, 500 ng of genomic DNA was amplified using NEBNext Ultra II 
Q5 HiFi polymerase (New England Biolabs) with primers containing 
stubbers for downstream indexing. The expected amplicon length was 
4.4 kb surrounding the cut site. The following PCR cycle conditions 
were used: denaturation at 98 °C for 30 s, followed by 25 cycles of 98 °C 
for 10 s, 60 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 5 min. PCR products were purified 
with 0.8× solid-phase reversible immobilization beads and eluted in 
H2O. Libraries were indexed and generated using the PCR barcoding 
expansion 1-96 (EXP-PBC096) for ligation sequencing kit (SQK-LSK114, 
Oxford Nanopore). Purified libraries were sequenced on a PromethION 
with the R10.4.1 flow cell. Read lengths were quantified using Summa-
rizeOntDels (https://github.com/cornlab/summarizeOntDeletions)32.
Statistical analyses
For assays involving kanR reversion on solid medium (Figs. 1g and 2b), 
unpaired, two-tailed Welch's t-tests were performed on log-normal 
data. Figure error bars display the s.d. For the nonselective editing 
experiment (Supplementary Fig. 3), a one-way analysis of variance was 
performed to test for the effect of editor-sgRNA combinations on the 
percentage of reads showing an SNV at the target thymidine. For the 
assay involving deletion strains in E. coli (Fig. 2e), unpaired, one-tailed 
Welch's t-tests were performed on log-normal data. Figure error bars 
display the s.d. For short-read next-generation sequencing data 
(Figs. 3f,g and 4c-e,g), unpaired, two-tailed Welch's t-tests were per-
formed. Figure error bars display the s.e.m. For the editing window 
experiment (Fig. 4f), the median and quartiles of each group are dis-
played. Related P-value calculations can be found in the Source Data 
and Supplementary Data 1.
