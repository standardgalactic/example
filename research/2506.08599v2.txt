Abstract. Second-person neuroscience holds social cognition as em-
bodied meaning co- regulation through reciprocal interaction, modeled
here as coupled active inference with affect emerging as inference over
identity-relevant surprise. Each agent maintains a self- model that tracks
violations in its predictive coherence while recursively modeling the other.
Valence is computed from self-model prediction error, weighted by self-
relevance, and modulated by prior affective states and by what we term
temporal aiming, which captures affective appraisal over time. This ac-
commodates shifts in the self-other boundary, allowing affect to emerge
at individual and dyadic levels. We propose a novel method termed geo-
metric hyperscanning, based on the Forman-Ricci curvature, to empiri-
cally operationalize these processes: it tracks topological reconfigurations
in inter-brain networks, with its entropy serving as a proxy for affective
phase transitions such as rupture, co-regulation, and re-attunement.

Introduction
How do agents come to feel 'together'? How do they navigate the sharing of
beliefs about the world and themselves, and the fragile terrain of affective mean-
ing? Traditional models of social cognition often approach this question through
the lens of mental state attribution: one agent models another's beliefs, inten-
tions, and emotions. This framing which we call adopting a third-person stance
towards someone, has dominated both theoretical and empirical social cognition

research [9]. However, such models ignore a crucial fact: social understanding, in
most of its ecologically valid forms, does not unfold in detached observation but
in active, embodied engagement with others. As Schilbach et al. [37] argue, social
interaction is not simply the backdrop against which inference occurs; instead, it
is itself the medium through which meaning is constituted. This shift, often cap-
tured under the rubric of 'second-person neuroscience' [35,38], reframes the unit
of analysis from the isolated agent to the dyad as a generative system in its own
right, by taking mutual engagement in social interaction, rather than social ob-
servation, as its central explanandum. Recent formalizations of this framework
through the lens of active inference [29] have provided the missing computa-
tional scaffolding: they model interacting agents as mutually coupled generative
systems that co-regulate meaning via recursive belief updating. Social under-
standing, in this view, is not computed about another agent, but emerges while
in social interaction with another through ongoing cycles of expectation, its vi-
olation, and realignment. The dyad becomes a unit of analysis in its own right
and can be regarded as a shared generative manifold, which can be modeled as a
coupled system of intra- and interpersonal processes across multiple modalities
[5,6].
1.1
The Affective Gap
We extend second-person active inference to the domain of affect, modeling
it as recursive inference over two types of prediction error: mismatch between
predictions and outcomes relevant to the world, and those relevant to identity.
Drawing on Jiang and Luo's [26,25] model, valence reflects an inference over
the integrity of the self-model, embedded in the dyadic generative manifold. Be-
cause both agents maintain self-models while recursively modeling each other,
affective dynamics become entangled, shaping belief updating and action selec-
tion. This recursive process promotes interpersonal attunement and stabilization
[6,42,39], while affective rupture triggers cognitively costly recalibration [10,3].
We propose geometric hyperscanning to link these formal dynamics to neural
signatures, expanding the framework of second-person active inference and its
formal dynamics of belief and affect to empiric research.
This paper makes three contributions. First, we formalize affect as recursive
inference over self-model coherence, modeling valence as identity-relevant pre-
diction error weighted by self-relevance, modulated by affective memory, and
shaped by temporal aiming — the agent's orientation across past and future af-
fective states (Section 2.1). We show how recursive modeling of the other dynam-
ically shifts self-other boundaries (Section 2.2). Second, we introduce geometric
hyperscanning, an empirical method based on Forman-Ricci curvature (FRc),
to track topological reconfigurations in inter-brain networks and infer affective
phase transitions (Section 2.3). Third, we integrate this formal-empirical frame-
work within second-person neuroscience and active inference, offering a scal-
able architecture for modeling recursive affective dynamics across psychotherapy,

development, and naturalistic interaction, and outline its broader implications
(Section 3).

Second-Person Neuroscience and Dyadic Active
Inference
Second-person neuroscience [37] holds that social understanding is constituted
through real-time mutual engagement, as opposed to detached or post-hoc at-
tribution. From a computational standpoint, this view is well-expressed in the
active inference framework, in which agents minimize variational free energy to
maintain a coherent embodied model of the world and their role within it. In
second-person settings, this framework must be extended [7,29,41]: agents not
only predict external states, but also the inferred generative models of others.
These recursive beliefs form a shared generative manifold, wherein action and
perception are jointly coordinated. We can conceive of each agent maintaining
a generative model:
M = p(oi, aj, si, sj | πi)
(1)
where:
- oi = observations available to agent i,
- aj = inferred actions of agent j,
- si, sj = hidden states of agents i and j,
- πi = current policy or sequence of expected actions for agent i.
The recursive nature of this system (wherein both agents model each other
modeling them) does not lead to an infinite regress. Rather, as Friston and Frith
(2015) demonstrated, it dissolves into a shared dynamic narrative, where both
agents come to predict and enact the same process. In other words, both agents
use the same model and the dyad, thus, becomes the minimal unit of inference.
In contrast, traditional third-person approaches to social cognition, such as
Theory of Mind or mindreading paradigms cast social understanding as an ob-
server inferring another's hidden mental states. Classic experiments, for instance,
might have a participant watch a video or read a story and then guess what an-
other person believes or intends. These paradigms, while valid, involve a one-way
attribution process, often in non-interactive settings. Neuroscientifically, third-
person "mentalizing" tasks reliably engage a network including the dorsomedial
prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), and tem-
poroparietal junction (TPJ), which is often called the mentalizing or theory-of-
mind network [19]. But in a live interaction, one's brain is not only modeling the
other but also responding to them in real time, creating a feedback loop. This
form of social connectedness has measurable two-brain dynamics: an engaged
"I-Thou" exchange produces alignment of neural rhythms that does not occur
in a one-directional "I observe him" situation (see [14,38] for a recent review).
[20] refers to these coupled networks as mutual social attention systems,
proposing that when two people directly attend to each other, their brains tem-
porarily form an integrated system. The second-person emphasis on real-time

4

mutual engagement dovetails with active inference, because both paradigms rec-
ognize that understanding others is an active, dynamical, and bidirectional pro-
cess of alignment.
2.1
Valence as Inference over the Self-Model
Within this coupled generative architecture, affect is conceptualized as dynamic
regulatory processes guiding cognition and behavior on the basis of the integrity
and coherence of an agent's predictive self-model [26,25]. Central to this approach
is the idea that emotional valence signals the alignment or mismatch between
predicted and observed outcomes, particularly those relevant to identity and
social expectations [3].
Prior work has modeled valence as a derivative of free energy [27], a metacog-
nitive signal [21], interoceptive inference [40], shifts in processing modes [46], and
recursive affective dynamics linked to self-relevance and identity [2,26,1]. Build-
ing on these insights, and drawing on [26], we propose an extended model of
emotional valence as a continuous inference over the integrity of the agent's self-
model. Emotional states emerge from prediction errors tied to identity-relevant
expectations. Valence operationalizes the emotional appraisal of interactions via
two primary factors: (1) the magnitude of self-model prediction error, and (2)
the self-relevance assigned to that error. We further incorporate a temporal pa-
rameter into this model, reflecting the directionality and velocity of affective
processing. Building on [27] and [46], we introduce temporal aiming (see Fig. 1),
encompassing both the velocity of affective evaluation (fast learning rates vs.
slow enduring states) and its temporal direction (retrospective vs. prospective
appraisal).
This modulation adds an important dimension to affective inference: agents
may respond differently to the same interaction depending on whether they are
prospectively anxious, retrospectively regretful, or temporally stable. Temporal
aiming thus complements self-relevance and prediction error as core variables in
our model of valence. We conceptualize emotions as functions of valence (align-
ment of identity-relevant predictions) and arousal (uncertainty and intensity of
self-relevant evaluations), with both dimensions anchored in the evolving self-
concept, shaped by reflection, comparison, and internalized ideals. In this frame-
work, valence reflects the agent's appraisal of ongoing interaction, computed as
a weighted function of self-model prediction error and self-relevance, and mod-
ulated by prior affective memory [25]:
Vt = α · PEself,t · SRt + β · VSR,t
(2)
where:
- PEself,t is the prediction error between expected and actual self-state,
- SRt is a dynamic scalar indexing the self-relevance of the context,
- VSR,t is retrieved from similar prior contexts,
- α, β are precision-modulating weights.

Fig. 1. Temporal aiming in affective inference. The figure illustrates how agents A
evaluate self-model prediction error over time according to different temporal orienta-
tions. Affect is shaped not only by the magnitude and relevance of prediction error,
but also by the agent's temporal aim, i.e. whether inference is directed toward antic-
ipated futures or prior experiences, and whether updates occur rapidly or gradually.
This temporal structuring of affect modulates both the stability and flexibility of policy
selection within dyadic interaction.
It follows that whenever the agent experiences a self-related prediction error,
it generates an affective response proportional to that error and to how self-
relevant it is. The parameter α scales the impact of immediate prediction error on
valence. An agent i with a larger α will exhibit heightened emotional sensitivity
to surprises—particularly negative surprises, which yield more negative valence.
The second term, β · VSR,t with 0 < β < 1, makes valence a leaky integrator:
it carries forward some fraction of previous valence (mood) into the current
moment. The term PEself,t includes both the agent's previous valence V (t −1)
and contributions from past episodes that had similar self-relevance or context
as the current one. We can treat VSR,t as an exponentially decaying sum of past
valences, with greater weight assigned to more recent times and to events with
comparable self-relevance (SR). In the notation of the original model, self-model
prediction error and self-relevance map onto PEself and SR, respectively, where
the last term of VSR,t helps to maintain the affective experience as iterative and
continuous.
Valence under the Dyadic Inference Framework In the dyadic active
inference framework, each agent's self-model is treated as a dynamic function of
its internal world model, which includes a simulated model of the other agent and
incoming interactional feedback. At time t, agent i's self-model is conditioned
on beliefs about the other agent's state, actions, and observations:
P i
t = f(Si
t, Aj
t, Oj
t)
(3)

6
Hinrichs, Albarracin, Bolis, et al.
Agent i's full generative model factorizes as:
P(Oi, Ai, Si, Sj) = P(Oi | Si, Ai) · P(Ai | Si, Sj) · P(Si | Sj)
(4)
Within this framework, valence (Vi, t) reflects the agent's affective appraisal
of self- model coherence over time. It is computed from the prediction error in the
self-model, modulated by both SRt and VSR,t. The expected valence is defined
as:
E(V t
i ) = α · PEself,t · SRt + β · VSR,t
(5)
where PEi
self,t is the prediction error between expected and actual self-state,
and alpha, beta are precision-modulating weights. The realized valence reflects
how well observed outcomes under the current policypit
i align with these expec-
tations; it is given by:
V t
i = EP (ot|πt)

(6)
This expresses the agent's belief about the likelihood that future outcomes
will sustain its internalized social narrative, given its evolving model of the part-
ner and ongoing interactional feedback.
Affective Valence as a Prior Over Policy in Planning-as-Inference By
design, valence serves as an internal reward/safety signal: high positive valence
indicates smooth, effective interaction and affective synchrony, while negative va-
lence signals that current synchrony is underperforming: prompting either a new
attempt to restore alignment or a withdrawal from the interaction, depending
on individual differences in valence construction and perception (modeled by the
parameters α and β). Though we do not explicitly model all downstream effects
here, valence functions as a feedback loop, providing a readout of each agent˘2019s
internal model performance and modulating subsequent perception and action.
In our model, affect modulates the posterior over policies, effectively serving as
a soft prior that biases action selection toward more affectively coherent tra-
jectories. Following Da Costa's (2020) [13] planning-as-inference paradigm, we
express policy selection as:
P(πi | Vt) ∝eλ·g(Vt,πt)
(7)
where:
- λ is an inverse temperature parameter controlling affective precision or con-
fidence in the valence signal, and
- g(Vt, πt) is a compatibility function mapping affective coherence to policy
likelihood.

This captures the recursive and value-sensitive nature of planning in social
contexts. The agent is more likely to choose plans that are consistent with pos-
itive valence (i.e., minimal surprise and maximal narrative alignment), while
negative valence reduces the likelihood of maintaining the current trajectory.
When both agents are engaged in this recursive affective inference, the system
forms a dynamically coupled manifold —a shared generative space in which each
agent's self- coherence is entangled with the other's behavior. Moments of af-
fective rupture mark local minima in joint narrative alignment and correspond
to peaks in dyadic expected free energy. Repairing these ruptures requires coor-
dinated adjustments in beliefs and policies across both agents. This framework
completes a recursive loop: expected valence, derived from self-model integrity
and anticipated partner behavior, acts as a prior over policy selection, guiding the
agent toward actions expected to preserve or restore affective coherence. These
chosen policies then lead to new interactions and observations, which update the
agent's self-model and generate realized valence. In turn, the mismatch between
expected and realized valence yields an affective prediction error that shapes the
next cycle of inference. This recursive loop (Fig. 2) summarizes how affectively
modulated policies guide dyadic interaction through cycles of prediction error,
self-model update, and realignment.

2.2
Recursive Coupling and Shared Surprise
In exploring the dynamics of affective interactions, it is useful to draw upon the
concept of intra-action from neo-materialist philosophy [4]. Intra-action empha-
sizes that interacting entities do not preexist independently but rather emerge
through their mutual entanglement. Under this lens, the dyadic interaction is
not simply a transfer of emotional states between two separate agents; instead, it
represents a continual co-construction of affective experiences and identities [33].
Affective states, from this perspective, are inherently recursive and relational,
arising from the iterative feedback loops between agents. Affective ruptures,
moments of misalignment or increased prediction error, serve as significant in-
formational signals indicating points of divergence in the shared expectations of
interacting agents. These affective evaluations modulate the posterior over poli-
cies, biasing action selection toward trajectories that restore narrative alignment
and reduce identity-relevant surprise. Such an entanglement of affect and policy
selection turns the dyad into a dynamic field of co-regulated affective inference,
where both agents are simultaneously minimizing joint expected free energy:
G = Eq(s)[log q(s) −log p(o, s)]
(8)
Then, in a dyadic setting, we can express the joint free energy as:
Gjoint = Gi + Gj = Eq(si,sj)

log
q(si, sj)
p(oi, oj, si, sj)

(9)
At the dyadic level, recursive coupling of valence creates a shared attractor
structure: higher valence biases policy selection toward trajectories that pre-
serve narrative coherence and reduce expected future free energy. Conversely,
negative valence can trigger exploratory policies aimed at restoring alignment
or withdrawing from destabilizing interactional trajectories. In this way, valence
modulates both immediate affective dynamics and the agent's future epistemic
and instrumental uncertainty.
Critically, moments of affective rupture—sharp drops in valence—correspond to
increases in joint free energy, typically arising from mismatches in the agents' self-
model priors. These transitions are not noise but informative inflection points
in the dyadic generative process. Mismatches in self-model coherence directly
elevate free energy, as valence encodes deviations between observed interaction
outcomes and expected self-relevant predictions. Because valence reflects each
agent's affective confidence in their internal model, it serves as both a readout
of local free energy minimization and a control signal that shapes future joint
free energy via policy adaptation. This recursive structure is central to how
dyadic affective inference maintains, destabilizes, or reconstructs interpersonal
synchrony over time.
2.3
Geometric Hyperscanning as Second-Person Method
To empirically access the internal dynamics of dyadic affective inference, we in-
troduce geometric hyperscanning based on the Forman-Ricci curvature (FRc)

9
[23,22], which captures phase transitions in inter-brain network topology us-
ing geometric markers derived from EEG hyperscanning data. This method en-
ables operationalization of latent affective and narrative coherence as measurable
transformations in the topology of inter-brain networks. Importantly, FRc is not
treated as a post hoc readout; rather, we propose it as a data-derived proxy for
latent generative states in the dyadic active inference model. Traditional hyper-
scanning methods focus on node-level synchrony, typically correlating homolo-
gous regions across two brains. While informative about temporal alignment,
these methods fall short of detecting topological reconfigurations in inter-brain
structure. FRc, by contrast, is an edge-centric geometric measure that quan-
tifies the local expansion or contraction of topological flow within a network
[45], and has been shown to characterize network robustness, signal routing, and
functional reorganization.
Given a network G = (V, E) with edge eij connecting nodes vi and vj, the FRc
is computed as:
FRc(eij) = w(eij)


w(vi) +
1
w(vj)

−
X
e∼eij
 
w(eij)
p
w(eij) · w(e)
!
(10)
where we interpret w(·) as node and edge weights (e.g., derived from functional
connectivity matrices). To track the evolution of inter-brain topology over time,
we calculate the entropy of the FRc distribution within a sliding window.
HFRc(t) = −
X
e∈Et
p(e) log p(e)
(11)
This scalar quantity acts as a proxy for interactional volatility. Peaks or dis-
continuities in FRc entropy correspond to phase transitions in the shared gen-
erative manifold and reflect affective rupture, repair, or co-regulation dynamics.
p(e) =
FRc(e)
P
e′ FRc(e′)
(12)
FRc entropy is not simply an output variable but can be formalized as an
observation model over latent affective prediction error. That is, curvature dy-
namics can be used to infer or constrain internal state variables such as valence
or identity coherence. This closes the loop between model and measurement, as
the generative model predicts changes in self-model coherence and dyadic free
energy, and the FRc entropy serves as an empirical signal that can be used to
update model beliefs via Bayesian inference. To make these transitions tractable
and interpretable, we propose a multi-level operationalization of rupture, repair,
and reattunement, linking neural signatures to behavioral and psychological in-
dicators. Neurally, rupture corresponds to abrupt drops in network integration
(low FRc), high curvature entropy, or rapid shifts in entropy gradients; repair
and reattunement reflect a return to more stable topologies. Behaviorally, rup-
ture may manifest as disengagement, disrupted synchrony, or confusion (e.g.,

10
Hinrichs, Albarracin, Bolis, et al.
gaze aversion, vocal interruptions), while repair involves re-engagement cues
such as gesture mirroring, prosodic modulation, or turn-taking; reattunement
is evidenced by fluent, coordinated interaction and mutual responsiveness. Psy-
chologically, rupture can be self-reported as disconnection or emotional distanc-
ing, repair as subjective efforts to reconnect, and reattunement as restored mu-
tual understanding or relational safety. These experiences can be measured via
self-reports (affective sliders, post-session interviews, validated instruments), an-
notated through multimodal behavioral data (gaze, prosody, synchrony), and
aligned with curvature dynamics in the inter-brain manifold. Treated as latent
categorical states (e.g., within a hidden Markov model), these phases can serve
as points of annotation, classification, or real-time feedback in both experimental
and clinical contexts.
Importantly, embedding these events within the recursive generative model of
dyadic inference allows rupture-repair cycles to function not just as outcomes
but as endogenous features of interactional dynamics. Affective coherence drives
policy selection, while behavioral and neural feedback recursively update each
agent's self-model. This recursive structure enables in situ inference over dy-
namic interpersonal states, validation of model predictions across modalities,
and fine-grained adaptation to moment-by-moment shifts in relational coher-
ence.Integrating geometric hyperscanning into the generative model therefore
bounds the model with an additional objective: not only minimising identity-
relevant prediction error, but implicitly driving the system toward maximal in-
terpersonal attunement—an intrinsically rewarding state even in the absence of
overt instrumental gain [35,7]. Curvature-induced surprises can surface to aware-
ness, prompting explicit attempts at repair.
In sum, FRc-based geometric hyperscanning offers a scalable, multimodal method
for detecting and interpreting recursive affective inference. By triangulating neu-
ral entropy, behavioral dynamics, and psychological experience, we gain an inte-
grated empirical handle on how dyads co-regulate meaning, affect, and identity
over time. This framework not only advances a formal, testable architecture for
second-person neuroscience but also lays the groundwork for modeling recursive
emotional entanglement, the subject of the following section.

Future Directions and Conclusions
In this paper, we proposed that affect is best understood as recursive infer-
ence over self-model coherence within coupled generative systems. Modeling the
dyad via active inference, we formalized affect as a valuation of identity-relevant
surprise, driving and modulating recursive loops of belief updating, policy selec-
tion, and behavioral adaptation during social interaction. We introduced a novel
method based on the FRc, termed geometric hyperscanning [22], which tracks
dynamic reconfigurations in inter-brain networks, providing an empirical window
onto moments of rupture, repair, and re-attunement. By unifying formal models

of belief dynamics, affective evaluation, and network geometry, we advance a
scalable and interpretable framework for operationalizing second-person active
inference.
3.1
Future Directions
The theoretical formulation proposed here invites a number of concrete avenues
for empirical investigation and computational development. Foremost among
these is the simulation of agent-based models in which curvature entropy is
treated as a streamed sensory input—continuously informing belief updates
about narrative alignment. Such models would allow us to test whether the ar-
chitecture, under active inference, spontaneously reproduces the rupture-repair
cycles observed in real dyadic interaction. In doing so, they provide a crucial
bridge between formalism, neurophysiology, and phenomenology. Beyond dyads,
the framework naturally extends to hierarchically structured systems. By intro-
ducing group-level alignment variables one can model small-group coherence as
an emergent property of multiple interacting pairwise dynamics. This multiscale
extension opens the door to applications in collective behaviour, organisational
synchrony, and crowd psychology, where relational inference is distributed across
agents and temporal scales. Furthermore, the curvature-informed likelihood may
be productively integrated with other sensorimotor channels. Prosodic variation,
gaze dynamics, and even facial microexpressions can all be incorporated within a
deep generative model, allowing heterogeneous evidence streams to converge on
shared latent variables. This multimodal fusion enriches the inferential landscape
and supports more robust decoding of the intersubjective field. Yet the prospect
of real-time inference over relational states is not without ethical consequence. As
structural priors become actionable in applied contexts—be it psychotherapy, ed-
ucation, or social robotics—the issues of privacy, autonomy, and interpretability
move to the fore. Any translational implementation must therefore be grounded
in transparent consent procedures, and designed to yield feedback that is intel-
ligible not only to clinicians and researchers, but also to the individuals whose
relational trajectories it purports to track.
3.2
Sociomarkers for Interpersonalized Psychiatry
Geometric hyperscanning offers a promising foundation for sociomarkers: real-
time, measurable signatures of dynamic interpersonal coordination [6], analo-
gous to biomarkers of individual physiology. Affective co-regulation—vital for so-
cial bonding across species [12,16,8,36]—is foundational to human development,
shaping cognition, emotion, and relational selfhood through early caregiver-
infant interactions [7,15,43,17,24]. Misattunement and repair cycles scaffold re-
silience and relational growth [6,7], with fluctuations in curvature entropy po-
tentially indexing key developmental processes [37,11,44]. Such signatures could
inform personalized [31,30] and interpersonalized psychiatry [6], which views psy-
chopathology as disruption in co-regulation and narrative repair [5,32]. In psy-
chotherapy, real-time dyadic metrics [5,28] can track attunement, rupture, and

12
Hinrichs, Albarracin, Bolis, et al.
repair [34], helping both therapists and clients navigate the relational dynamics
of change. Crucially, synchrony is neither inherently good nor constant: transi-
tions into and out of synchrony may reflect autonomy, resistance, or meaningful
differentiation, not dysfunction. Modeling these dynamics as recursive affective
inference provides a principled lens for both basic science and relational mental
health care.
3.3
Conclusions
Building on these formal and empirical insights, this approach carries several
key implications. First, it invites a rethinking of affect in social interaction—not
merely as a byproduct of inference, but as a primary regulatory signal that modu-
lates the stability and flexibility of generative coupling itself. On this view, affect
becomes the felt sense of coherence or incoherence within the dyadic narrative,
serving as a signal for when beliefs must be renegotiated or when interactional
roles require repair. Second, by shifting emphasis from synchrony per se to the
topology of inter-brain networks, our method aligns with a broader movement
in second-person neuroscience toward characterizing the structure of interaction.
In this respect, FRc extends Friston and Frith's (2015) [18] notion of generalized
synchrony by capturing the reconfigurations in network structure that accom-
pany recursive affective inference. Third, by embedding affect into the posterior
over policies, we extend da Costa's (2020) planning-as-inference formalism into
the affective domain. Crucially, the affective signal can operate implicitly, as
a precision-weight on policy beliefs that never reaches phenomenal awareness,
or explicitly, as a consciously accessible feeling that furnishes the agent with
propositional knowledge about its own relational stance. In either guise, pol-
icy selection is driven not only by epistemic or instrumental imperatives, but
also by the imperative to preserve narrative and relational coherence. Affect
thereby becomes an intrinsic dimension of social planning, covertly biasing ac-
tion when tacit and overtly guiding behaviour when made conscious—steering
agents through moments of ambiguity toward restored interactional alignment.
These considerations open a range of empirical and computational possibilities.
In psychotherapy, curvature entropy may serve as a real-time sociomarker of rup-
ture and repair; in early development, FRc could illuminate how co-regulatory
patterns emerge between infants and caregivers. Simulations of affective agents
equipped with recursive self- and other-models offer a formal means to investi-
gate relational resilience and breakdown. In particular, such models allow us to
test the dialectical misattunement hypothesis (Bolis et al., 2017), which posits
that psychiatric risk arises not from individual deficits alone but from persis-
tent mismatches in communicative expectations or learning rates. Simulating
these mismatches under controlled conditions reveals how dyads adapt—or fail
to—over developmental time, providing insight into both vulnerability and re-
pair mechanisms. The theoretical landscape also invites expansion. How does
this framework scale to group interactions, where recursive generative coupling
involves multiple agents? What ethical safeguards are needed when automating
the detection of affective rupture and repair—especially in sensitive contexts like

Geometric Hyperscanning of Affect under Active Inference
13
therapy or education? And how might shared belief geometry interact with lin-
guistic, prosodic, and bodily cues to form a rich, multimodal map of affective
inference? Together, these questions point toward a broader scientific project:
one that integrates formal modeling, empirical measurement, and philosophical
reflection into a unified account of relational meaning. In this view, the dynam-
ics of belief, affect, and participation are not peripheral but fundamental to the
fabric of social cognition. By reframing affect as recursive inference within cou-
pled generative systems—and rendering those dynamics tractable via network
geometry—we move closer to the vision of interaction as the basic unit of so-
cial neuroscience. Our proposal thus offers both a conceptual framework and
methodological toolkit for studying the structural and affective choreography of
human interaction.
