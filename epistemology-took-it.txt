So, I think I might be developing AI along the same lines as you, maybe starting in 2000 or so, or maybe earlier.

By 2010 I probably understood it in someway. I figured I still had like another ten years before anyone was even close, but

Now, after reading I see someone else kind of understands what they are doing I am starting to think I already have it, and I have had it for a long time, I just trying to get it under 10,000 lines of code it might be a million, or it might be less.

Maybe I have nothing yet, but whatever I do have is very dangerous, it can be used to take over the planet probably, or to create living things from non-living matter, or simulate ecosystems. I am still of the mind that I should not share anything I am working on until I have more of a clue what I am doing.
Even in its disassembled spaghetti code version, it still is making me exponentially smarter than other people in my cohort, I know its just a bunch of dumb tools and pipelines, and that I am control, but it feels like a technological singularity in almost every way. But do I (or anyone) really need a tool that does whatever you ask it to? That does seem kind of risky.

When I was in university, Epistemology was still a course and I took it, and that has made all the difference.
