y  =~2  illustrated  in  Fig.  4.  From  the  table  of  values  of  the  function  we  see 

that  the  value  of  the  function  increases  increasingly  more  rapidly  than  the 
values  of  the  independent  variable  and  so  the  ordinates  are  not  proportional  to 
the  abscissas.  If  in  Fig.  4  we  connect  O  with  A ,  O  with  B,  O  with  C,  O  with  Dt 
respectively,  we  see  that  the  lines  OA,  OB,  OC,  and  OD  have  different  angles 
with  the  axis  X'X ;  the  respective  triangles  are  not  similar,  and  so  there  is  no 
proportionality.  The  lines  OA,  OB,  OC,  OD  .  ,  do  not  represent  a  straight  line 
as  they  have  all  different  angles  with  the  axis  XX'  and  so  the  points  A,  B, 
C,  D  .  ,  cannot  lie  on  a  straight  line  but 'represent  a  broken  line  which,  in  the 
limit,  when  the  points  plotted  become  sufficiently  near  together,  becomes  a 
smooth  and  continuous  curve. 

The  fact  that  equations  in  which  the  variables  are  only  of  the  first  degree, 
represent  straight  lines,  and  that  equations  of  higher  degrees  represent  curved 
lines  is  very  important,  as  will  appear  later  on.  We  must  notice  also  that  the 
problem  of  linearity  is  connected  with  proportionality . 

These  few  simple  notions  concerning  the  use  of  co-ordinates  will  allow  us 
to  explain  the  geometrical  meaning  of  the  derivative  and  the  differential. 

SEMANTICS  OF  THE  DIFFERENTIAL  CALCULUS  S87 

Consider  Pi  and  P% ,  (Fig.  6)  two  points  on  the  curve,  y**/(x),  referred  to 
the  axes  OX  and  OF.  Drop  perpendiculars  PXMX  and  P2M%  from  Pi  and  P2 
to  OX.  These  are  the  ordinates  yi  -/(*  1)  and  y2  =/(*2)  of  the  points  Pi  and  P2, 

and  OM\  and  OM2  are  the  abscissas  xx 
and  xt  of  the  points  Pi  and  P*.  Through 
Pi  draw  the  secant  PXP%,  the  tangent  to 
the  curve  P\T,  and  the  line  P\Q  parallel 
to  OX.  Then  PxQ  represents  Ax  =x2—xx 
the  change  in  the  variable  x,  and  P%Q 
represents  Ay =y2  —  yi  =/(*a)  — fixi)  the 
change  in  the  function  y. 

In  the  right  triangle  PXQP%  the  ratio 
PtQ/PxQ  is  a  measure  (the  tangent) 
of  the  angle  P%PiQ  ( — «)  that  is,  tan  a 

-P»Q/PiQ-^y/^-^r~  or< 

since  x2  =xx  4- Ax 
we  may  write 

tan  a  = 

/(xi+Ax)-/(xi) 

Ax 

As  P,  approaches  Pi  along  the  curve,  the  secant  PiPj  rotates  about  Pi 
approaching  PiP  as  its  limit,  and  the  tangent  of  a  approaches  the  tangent 
of  t,  t  being  the  angle  which  PiT,  the  tangent  to  the  curve  at  Pi,  makes  with 
PiQ.  But  as  Pj  approaches  Pi,  A*=*s  — =  approaches  zero  or 

symbolically  as  Ax  -4  0;  (Ay/A*)->  tan  r,  that  is  tan  r  =  ]im  (Ay/A*). 

We  see  that  the  lim  yt~—  -  lim  ^  represents  nothing  more  or  less 

X2~*xi  X2—XX  &X—*0 

than  the  derivative  of  the  function  representing  the  curve.  In  other  words, 
the  geometrical  interpretation  of  the  analytical  process  of  differentiation  is  the 
finding  of  the  slope  of  the  graph  of  the  function.  The  increment  Ay  of  the 
function  is  represented  by  P2Q\  the  differential  dy  is  equal  to  NQ  and  Ax  = 

dx~PiQ;  tan  Z  TPxQ^ 

From  the  above  considerations  we  see  that  the  differential  calculus  gives, 
by  the  application  of  some  extremely  simple  structural  principles,  a  method 
of  analysis  by  which  we  can  discover  a  tendency  at  a  particular  stage  rather 
than  the  final  outcome  after  a  definite  interval.  From  such  fundamental  yet 
simple  beginnings  the  whole  calculus  is  developed.  Most  of  these  developments 
are  not  needed  for  our  purpose,  but  we  will  explain  one  specially  important 
theorem.  The  theorem  in  question  is  that  the  derivative  of  the  sum  of  two 
functions  is  equal  to  the  sum  of  their  derivatives.  In  symbols 

Dx(u  +v)  +Dxv.

Let  us  symbolize  «  +e  =>y  and  select  a  special  value 

then 
we  have 

we  have 

(4) 

yo  +Ay  ** «o  -FA u  +vq  +Av.  By  subtracting  (4), 

Ay  =  A u  +Ai».  Dividing  by  Ax, 

Ay  A u  Av 

T~=T~+T~*  When  Ax  approaches  zero  the 

left-hand  side  approaches  Dxy  =Dx(u+v);  and  the  first  term  of  the  right-hand 
approaches  Dxut  while  the  second  term  approaches  Dx v  and  so, 

£>x(u  -fv)  =*Dxu  +Dxi>. 

The  symbol  Dx  means  also  that  certain  operations  are  to  be  performed 
upon  our  function;  namely,  to  find  its  derivative.  When  used  in  this  sense  it 
is  called  an  operator.  The  operator  Dx  can  be  also  written  in  its  differential 

form  as  and  similarly  for  higher  derivatives. 

2.  MAXIMA  AND  MINIMA 

It  will  be  useful  to  have  some  applications  of  the  differential  calculus 
explained. 

If  a  function  y=f(x )  is  continuous  in  an  interval  a<x<b  and  has  larger 
(or  smaller)  values  at  some  intermediate  points  than  it  has  at  or  near  the  ends, 
then  it  has  a  maximum  (or  minimum)  at  some  point  x  inside  this  interval. 
If  Fig.  7  represents  the  graph  of  the  function,  it  is  obvious  that  at  the  maximum 
(or  minimum)  the  tangent  to  the  curve  is  parallel  to  the  axis  and  therefore 
the  slope  of  this  tangent  is  zero.  As  this  slope  is  given  by  the  derivative  and 
the  slope  is  zero  we  have  a  simple  method  of  finding  the  maximum  (or  the 
minimum)  of  a  function  by  equating  the  first  derivative  to  zero;  namely, 
Dxy  =0  when  x-x0. 

It  is  useful  to  be  able  to  discriminate  between  the  maximum  and  the 
minimum  of  a  function.  Fig.  7  shows  that  this  can  be  done  by  finding  means 
to  discriminate  between  the  two  cases  when  our  curve  is  concave  upwards  or 
concave  downwards.  The  slope  of  a  curve  for  a  particular  value  of  x 

is  given  by  the  value  of  Dxyt  cor¬ 
responding  to  that  value  of  x.  If 
the  value  Dxy  is  positive,  y  increases 
as  x  increases,  and  the  curve 
slopes  up  as  we  move  to  the  right; 
if  the  value  of  Dxy  is  negative, 
X  y  decreases  as  x  increases,  and 
the  curve  slopes  down  as  we  move 
to  the  right. 

If  we  consider  the  curve  y  =f(x )  which  has  its  concave  side  turned 
upward  (Fig.  8),  the  slope  of  the  curve  itself  is  a  function  of  x,  tan  a  =/'(*). 
If  we  consider  a  variable  point  P  on  a  curve  y  =/(*),  together  with  the  tangent 
to  the  curve  P ,  as  following  the  curve  in  the  direction  of  increasing  values  of  x , 
the  curve  is  concave  upward  whenever  the  slope  is  increasing  algebraically, 

SEMANTICS  OF  THE  DIFFERENTIAL  CALCULUS  589 

that  is  when  D ,  tan  a«0.  In  other  words,  the  curve  is  concave  upwards  for 
those  values  of  x  for  which  Dx  tan  a  is  positive,  or  since  tan  a  =Dxy  for  those 
values  of  x  for  which  Dx  tan  a  ■*  Dx(Dzy)  -  Dx2y  y 
Is  positive.  Similarly  a  curve  is  concave  down¬ 
wards  for  those  values  of  x  for  which  Dx  tan  a 
-Dx{Dxy)  =*D2y  is  negative.  These  results 
can  be  expressed  thus: 

A  curve  y  =/(x)  is  concave  upward  when 
Dz*y>  0,  or,  in  words,  when  the  second  de¬ 
rivative  is  positive,  and  the  curve  is  concave 
downward  when  the  second  derivative  is 
negative,  or,  in  symbols,  when  Dx2y  < 0.  0 

From  Fig.  7,  we  see  that  for  a  maximum 
we  must  have  our  tangent  parallel  to  the  X'X 

and  our  curve  concave  downwards,  hence  for  these  conditions  the  first  deriva¬ 
tive  [Dxy]x-xo  *  0,  and  the  second  derivative  [Dx2y\x-xo  <0.  For  a  minimum  the 
first  derivative  must  again  be  zero  and  the  second  derivative  positive,  whence 
the  concave  side  of  the  curve  is  turned  upwards.  It  should  be  noticed  that 
the  problems  of  maxima  and  minima  play  an  extremely  important  structural 
psycho-logical  and  semantic  role  in  our  lives.  All  theories,  somehow,  are  built 
6n  some  minimum  or  maximum  principle  involving  evaluations  which  are 
fundamental  factors  of  all  semantic  reactions.  In  daily  life  we  apply  these 
structural  and  semantic  notions  continually.  In  science  this  tendency,  made 
its  appearance  quite  early.  The  problem  of  maxima  and  minima  was  treated 
seriously  as  far  back  as  the  second  century  b.c.  In  the  eighteenth  century 
Maupertuis  formulated  a  ‘supreme  law  of  nature' ,  that  in  all  natural  processes 
the  ‘action*  (energy  multiplied  by  'time')  must  be  a  minimum.  Euler  and 
Lagrange  gave  an  exact  basis  and  form  to  this  principle;  and  finally  Hamilton, 
in  1834,  established  this  principle  structurally  as  a  variational  principle,  known 
as  the  hamiltonian  principle,  which  appears  to  be  of  extreme  generality  and 
usefulness.  It  facilitates  the  derivation  of  the  fundamental  equations  of 
mechanics,  electrodynamics  and  electron  theory.  It  has  also  survived,  in  a 
generalized  form,  the  einsteinian  revolution,  for  it  contains  nothing  whatever 
which  would  connect  it  with  a  definite  co-ordinate  system;  it  involves  only  pure 
numbers  and  so  is  invariant  to  all  transformations.  It  is  structurally  one  of  the 
most  important  invariants  ascribed  to  nature,  being  independent  of  the  systems 
of  reference  of  the  observers. 

It  is  very  desirable  that  this  problem  should  be  investigated  further  from 
the  structural  psycho-logical  semantic  and  neurological  point  of  view,  as  the 
very  foundations  of  human  psycho-logics  are  fundamentally  connected  with 
such  a  principle,  which  itself  is  an  invariant  in  human  psycho-logics. 

Its  importance  is  still  increasing,  and  the  hamiltonian  principle  plays  a 
most  remarkable  role  in  all  the  newest  advances  of  science.  Any  reader  need 
only  look  attentively  at  his  daily  life  to  realize  that  there  too  this  principle 
plays  a  predominant  role.

3.  CURVATURE 

In  modern  scientific  literature  we  hear  often  the  fundamental  term  'curva¬ 
ture  mentioned,  and  a  few  words  about  it  will  not  be  amiss.  If  we  take  two 
perpendicular  lines  X'OX  and  OY  and  select  on  OY  a  number  of  points  A, 

B,  C,  D . ,  further  and  further  away  from  0 
and  describe  arcs  of  circles  with  these  points  as 
centres  with  radii  AO ,  BO,  CO,  DO  . ,  respectively 
Fig.  9f  we  find  each  successive  arc  flatter  and 
closer  to  the  line  X'X  than  its  predecessor.  In 
other  words,  the  larger  the  radius  of  our  circle, 
the  flatter  its  arc  is.  In  the  limit  as  the  radius 
of  the  circle  becomes  indefinitely  large,  the  arc 
approaches  a  straight  line  by  intuition  and  by 
t  definition.  We  notice  also  that  the  curvature 

of  each  circle  is  uniform,  that  is,  one-valued  at  every  point;  but  that  when  we 
pass  from  one  circle  to  another  of  different  radius,  the  curvature  changes. 

If  we  consider  a  curve  and  two  points  on  it,  M1  and  M2,  (Fig.  10)  and 
raw  two  tangents  at  these  points;  then  the  angle  between  these  two  tangents 
will  depend  on  two  factors,  the  sharpness  of  the  curve  and  the  distance  between 

the  points  Mt  and  M2.  If  we  take  the 
points  near  enough  and  designate  the 
length  of  the  arc  between  them  by  As, 
the  angle  between  the  two  tangents 
by  AS,  then  the  limiting  value  of  the 
ratio  AS /As,  as  Jlf2  approaches  M\, 
becomes  dS/ds,  and  is  a  measure  of  the 
rate  of  change  of  the  direction  of  the 
tangent  at  M,  as  M  moves  along  the 
curve.  Let  us  designate  the  rate  at 
.  which  the  tangent  turns  where  the 

point  describes  the  curve  with  unit  velocity  as  the  curvature,  or  k=±d6/ds, 
ut  as  is  essentially  a  positive  number  or  zero  we  accept  only  the  absolute 
value  of  this  ratio.  To  find  dS/ds  we  notice  that  tan  6  =dy/dx 

tan~l  ^  =  tan-1  /,  whence  d8-  dy'  ^>dx

The  reciprocal  of  the  curvature  is  called  the  radius  of  curvature.  The  radius 
of  curvature  of  a  circle  is  its  radius.  The  curvature  of  a  curve  is  measured  by 
the  radius  of  the  osculating  circle,  that  circle  which  fits  the  curve  the  most 
closely  in  the  neighbourhood  of  our  point.

4.  VELOCITY 

Until  now  we  have  treated  our  independent  variables  as  any  quantity: 
but  there  are  many  problems  where  the  independent  variable  represents  'time'. 
For  instance,  if  we  travel  by  railroad  the  distance  increases  as  'time’  increases, 
plants  and  animals  grow  with  ‘time’,  .  By  the  average  velocity  with  which  a 
given  point  moves  for  a  given  length  of  ‘time’  we  mean  the  distance  s  traversed 
divided  by  the  ‘time’  elapsed.  If,  for  instance,  a  train  makes  5  miles  in  10 
minutes  we  say  that  its  average  velocity  is  30  miles  per  hour,  or,  in  symbols: 

Velocity,  v  —  -.  In  this  case  we  were  considering  uniform  velocity,  but  very 
t 

often  we  bave  to  deal  with  velocities  which  are  not  uniform  and  which  might 
be  increasing  or  decreasing.  In  such  a  case  we  can  describe  the  velocity 
approximately  at  any  given  moment  if  we  take  a  short  interval  of  ‘time’ 
immediately  after  the  moment  in  question  and  take  the  average  velocity  for 
this  short  interval. 

For  instance,  the  distance  a  stone  falls  is  according  to  the  law,  s  =  16  t2.  We 
want  to  find  how  fast  it  is  going  after  fa  seconds  when  si  =  16  fa2,  and  a  short 
interval  after  we  have,  let  us  say,  sz  =  16  fa2.  Obviously  the  average  velocity  for 

the  interval  fa— fa  is  — — —  feet  per  second.  If  we  take  fa -l,  $i  =  16,  and  the 
fa  —  *i 

difference  fa  —fa  =0.1  of  a  second  then  ^2  =  16  fa2  =  16  X  1.21  — 19.36  and 

$2 -Si  19.36-16  3.36  „  ,  .  , 

- — :  * — - - - -33.6  ft.  per  second. 

fa- fa  0.1  0.1 

If  we  take  the  interval  of  ‘time’  smaller,  for  instance,  1/100  of  a  second 

we  would  have  — - — -  =32.2  feet  per  second,  and  if  we  take  the  intervals  as 
fa  —fa 

1/1000  of  a  second  the  average  velocity  would  be  32.0  feet  per  second.  We  see 
that  we  could  determine  the  speed  of  the  stone  at  any  instant  with  any  degree 
of  accuracy  by  direct  calculation,  but  this  is  not  necessary.  If  we  regard  the 
interval  fa— fa  as  an  increment  of  the  variable  t ,  that  is  as  At,  and  s%—  si=As 
which  represents  the  increment  of  the  distance  considered  as  a  function  of 
the  ‘time’  we  would  have  the  average  velocity  =As/At .  As  At  approaches 
zero  in  the  limit,  the  average  velocity  approaches  a  limit  and  this  limit  is  the 
velocity  v  at  the  instant  fa,  or  in  symbols 

v  -  lim  —  =— .  In  words,  the  velocity  of  a 
V^oAt  to 

point  is  the  ‘time’  derivative  of  the  space  traveled. 

If  the  velocity  is  not  uniform,  the  rate  at  which  the  velocity  is  increasing 

is  called  the  acceleration  and  may  be  written  as  a  =  — ,  but  as  we  have  already

592  VIII.  ON  THE  STRUCTURE  OF  MATHEMATICS 

In  the  above  notes  we  have  not  attempted  to  give  the  reader  more  than 
some  structural  and  methodological  notions,  and  what  amount  really  to  short 
structural  explanations  of  definitions  which  will  be  useful  later  on.  The  reader 
can  find  many  excellent  books  which  give  all  the  additional  information  he 
may  want. 

Section  C.  On  the  integral  calculus. 

So  far,  we  have  been  studying  a  method  by  which  to  find  the  variation  of 
a  given  function  corresponding  to  an  indefinitely  small  variation  of  our  variable. 
We  saw  that  the  rate  of  change  of  our  function  was  given  by  the  first  derivative, 
which  in  turn  was  also  a  function  (usually  different)  of  our  independent  variable 
and  so  could  itself  vary  and  have  a  rate  of  change,  and  so  give  us  a  second 
derivative  ,  , 

And  now  we  must  explain  briefly  the  inverse  problem;  namely,  given  the 
derivative  to  find  the  function.  In  symbols,  given  u=DxU,  find  U. 

The  function  U  is  called  the  integral  of  u  with  respect  to  x,  or,  in  symbols 
V  —  J*udx. 

To  integrate  a  function  f(x)  is  to  find  a  function  F(x)  which  when  dif¬ 
ferentiated  gives  again  the  function  f(x)  with  which  we  started.  As  in  this 
work  we  are  not  interested  in  computations,  but  only  in  the  structural, 
methodological,  and  semantic  aspects,  the  inverse  problem  of  differentiation; 
namely,  integration,  is  less  important  for  us  here,  and  I  will  explain  only  a 
single  example.  We  have  already  differentiated  the  function  y  =  2x*-x+5  and 
found  its  derivative  dy/dx  =6x2-l.  Just  as  the  derivative  of  the  sum  of  a 
number  of  functions  is  equal  to  the  sum  of  their  derivatives,  a  similar  rule  holds 
for  the  integrals;  namely,  that  the  integral  of  the  sum  of  a  number  of  functions 
is  equal  to  the  sum  of  their  integrals.  Hence  we  can  take  in  our  example  only 
the  first  term  of  our  equation.  In  symbols  Dx(2x?)  *6x2;  in  words,  the  deriva¬ 
tive  of  2x*  is  6x 2. 

In  a  problem  in  integration  we  would  have  6x2  given  and  we  would  have 
to  find  the  original  function  from  which  6xz  was  obtained  by  differentiation. 
In  our  case  the  solution  is  already  given;  namely,  J'6xidx  =  2xs*  In  general 

the  solution  of  problems  of  integration  is  largely 
dependent  on  the  ingenuity  of  the  solver,  al¬ 
though  we  have  a  number  of  standard1  formulae 
and  methods.  The  geometrical  meaning  of  in¬ 
tegration  is  much  more  interesting  for  us  and 
we  will  give  a  Short  explanation  of  it. 

If  we  consider  the  curve  given  by  an  equa¬ 
tion  y  ~f(x)  and  the  area  bounded  by  the  X 
axis,  the  two  ordinates  whose  abscissas  are  x=a 
and  x—b  and  the  curve,  we  may  find  the  area 

as  follows: 

♦The  constant  of  integration  is  omitted  so  as  not  to  confuse  the  reader. 

SEMANTICS  OF  THE  DIFFERENTIAL  CALCULUS  593 

If  we  select  an  arbitrary  value  x  *=#1  for  which  y^yi  —fix i),  denoting  the 
corresponding  value  of  the  area  A  by  A\  (Fig.  11)  and  give  to  x\  an  increment 
fax,  then  the  area  Ai  Would  receive  the  increment  A^4.  We  can  approximate  AA 
by  the  help  of  two  rectangles,  one  of  height  yi-/(xi),  the  other  of  height 
y%  «  yi  +Ay  -/(**)  =/(*i  + Ax) . 

We  see  that  AA  is  larger  than  the  smaller  rectangle.  In  symbols 
yxAx  <AA  <(yi  +Ay)Ax, 

AA 

hence  yi  <—  <  Cyi  + Ay)  * 

Ax 

As  we  pass  to  the  limit  and  let  Ax  approach  zero,  we  have 

lim  —  =yi.  That  is,  D*A  =yi  =/(xi)  when  x=*xi;  which  means  that  the 
A*-*o  Ax 

ordinate  of  the  curve  at  any  point  is  equal  to  the  x  derivative  of  the  area  at 
that  point.  In  general,  D*A  -y,  and  hence,  A  =J*ydx. 

The  consideration  of  what  is  called  the  definite  integral  is  still  more 
Instructive.  Let  us  take  the  curve  in  Fig.  12  represented  by  an  equation  y  =/(x) 
and  a  pair  of  ordinates  which  intersect  the  X  axis  at  the  points  x  «x0  and  x=x„. 
Let  us  divide  the  interval  Xoxn  into  n 
equal  parts  and  erect  ordinates  at  each 
point  of  division.  Let  us  construct  a 
Bet  of  pairs  of  rectangles  with  these

tion  of  the  figure  we  see  that  the  area

angles  and  slightly  less  than  the  sum  of 
the  areas  of  the  including  rectangles.  When  n  is  allowed  to  increase  without 
limit  the  sum  of  the  areas  of  either  set  of  these  rectangles  approaches  the  area 
bounded  by  the  curve,  the  X  axis,  and  the  end  ordinates.  In  symbols,  the

as  we  let  n  increase  without  limit,  this  sum  will  approach  a  limit,  which  can  be 
found  by  integrating  the  function/!*),  that  is,  by  finding  the  function  F(x)  of 
which  /(*)  is  the  derivative,  and  by  taking  the  integral  between  the  limits 
*  -*o  and  *  -*„;  that  is,  by  taking  the  difference  between  F(xn)  and  F(*0). 

It  must  be  noticed  that  in  our  first  example,  the  case  of  the  indefinite 
integral,  we  considered  integration  as  the  inverse  of  differentiation;  in  the 
second  example,  we  considered  the  definite  integral  as  the  limit  of  a  sum. 

The  symbol  of  the  integral,  J~,  had  its  origin  in  the  letter  5  from  the  latin 
word  'summa’,  the  integral  being  historically  understood  as  the  definite 
integral,  or  the  limit  of  a  sum.

1.  partial  DIFFERENTIATION 
When  we  have  more  than  one  independent  variable,  for  example,  two, 
we  have  to  become  acquainted  with  what  is  called  partial  differentiation! 
This  process  is  important,  as  in  practice  we  usually  deal  with  several  independent 
variables.  It  presents  very  little  that  is  new  from  a  structural  and  method¬ 
ological  point  of  view,  but  we  give  it  here,  simply  to  explain  the  meaning  of 
the  term,  as  the  reader  may  find  it  used  in  other  works. 

If  we  have  a  function  z  of  two  independent  variables  *  and  y,  z=f(x,y) 
which  geometrically  represents  a  surface,  we  may  differentiate  with  respect  to 
one  of  the  variables,  let  us  say  *,  and  hold  the  other  variable  y  fast,  that  is, 
treat  it  as  a  constant.  In  this  way  we  should  then  have  a  partial  derivative 
of  z  with  respect  to  *.  Similarly,  if  we  treat  *  as  a  constant  and  differentiate 
in  respect  to  y,  we  should  have  the  partial  derivative  of  z  with  respect  to  y. 
The  above  definitions  give  us  the  rules  for  partial  differentiation— that  is! 
following  the  ordinary  rules,  considering  each  variable  individually  and  treating 
all  the  other  variables  as  constant. 

The  notation  for  partial  derivatives  is  similar  to  the  ones  explained  before, 
except  that  the  lower  case  letter  d  is  replaced  by  the  script  form  d  or  a  subscript 
is  used  to  indicate  the  variable  with  respect  to  which  the  differentiation  is 

performed;  for  instance,  -Zz' =Dff=Dxz  ,  .  Higher  derivatives  are 

obtained  without  difficulty  in  like  manner.  If  *-/(*, y)  and  —=/,'(*  y)  and 

dz  &X 

the  partial  derivatives  themselves  are  in  general  also  functions 

of  x  and  y  and  can  in  turn  be  differentiated.  Thus,  —  ( — ^  =f„  "(x  v)  or
