constructive  help  they  have  given  me  in  the  preparation  of  this  introduc¬

check.  I  am  also  genuinely  indebted  to  Miss  M.  Kendig,  Educational 
Director  of  the  Institute,  and  to  Doctor  Irving  J.  Lee  of  Northwestern 
University,  for  their  important  criticism  and  co-operation. 

Special  Acknowledgement 

On  behalf  of  students  of  general  semantics  who  have  attended  semi¬ 
nars  at  the  Institute,  and  on  my  own  behalf,  I  want  to  express  my  deep 
gratitude  to  Cornelius  Crane,  whose  vision,  interest,  and  financing  made 
possible  the  founding  of  the  Institute  in  1938.  The  widespread  influence 
and  rapid  development  of  the  work  of  the  Institute  in  this  world  turmoil 
became  a  living  reality  because  of  Mr.  Crane's  generous  contributions 
during  the  first  two  and  a  half  years  of  our  pioneer  effort.  Forces  of 
destruction  are  working  steadily,  and  Mr.  Crane  should  be  credited  with 
helping  to  organize  constructive  efforts. 

I  also  gratefully  acknowledge  the  contributions  of  the  other  students 
who  are  now  helping  to  support  the  work  of  the  Institute.

SUPPLEMENTARY  BIBLIOGRAPHY 

TO  THE  SECOND  EDITION 

The  following  bibliography  is  only  illustrative  of  points  made  in  the  introduction 
to  the  second  edition.  A  number  of  volumes  listed  here  give  extensive  bibliographies 
in  their  fields.  For  instance,  the  book  of  Dr.  Dunbar  has  130  pages  of  bibliography 
which  cover  2,358  items.  Some  of  the  most  important  and  latest  empirical  data  on 
electrical  brain-waves,  electro-physiology,  conditional  reactions  in  humans,  electro- 
colloidal  processes  of  the  nervous  system,  experimental  neuroses  and  psychoses  in 
animals,  the  reactions  of  apes,  data  on  human  psychotherapy,  the  methods  of  decep¬ 
tion  and  sensory  misdirection  as  utilized  by  magicians,  etc.,  are  given  mostly  in  tech¬ 
nical  journals  and  monographs,  and  the  interested  reader  may  find  them  in  libraries. 

This  applies  also  to  the  many  applications  of  the  methods  of  general  semantics 
in  education,  mental  hygiene,  speech  difficulties,  etc.,  carried  on  in  universities  and 
colleges,  as  well  as  applications  in  the  practice  of  physicians,  including  psychiatrists ; 
these  are  in  preparation,  or  printed  at  present  only  by  professional  journals  or  by 
the  Institute  of  General  Semantics  (see  special  list). 

I  list  also  some  new  pertinent,  professional  publications  such  as  Psychosomatic 
Medicine ,  Journal  of  Symbolic  Logic ,  Encyclopedia  of  Unified  Science ,  etc.,  without 
listing  the  titles  of  the  individual  contributions.  It  is  suggested  that  the  interested 
reader,  and  particularly  educators,  medical  men,  etc.,  become  acquainted  with  such 
material,  or  at  least  know  that  it  does  exist.  The  reader  is  also  referred  to  the  fore¬ 
word  to  the  bibliography  given  on  page  767,  and  the  titles  which  follow. 

In  science  and  life  a  great  deal  depends  on  proper  evaluation,  tested  by  predict¬ 
ability,  which  depends  in  turn  on  the  similarity  of  structure  between  territory-map 
or  fact-language.  Thus,  we  have  to  know  scientific  facts,  as  well  as  the  intricacies 
and  difficulties  of  language  and  its  structure.  Fortunately  there  is  a  weekly  Science 
News  Letter ,  published  by  Science  Service,  Washington,  D.  C,  giving  brief,  authori¬ 
tative,  non-technical  factual  summaries  of  progress  in  science,  mathematics,  medicine, 
etc.,  including  sources,  which  every  specialist  as  well  as  intelligent  layman  should 
know.
