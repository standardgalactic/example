continuous  jumps  into  'continuous’  smooth  entities.  Because  of  the  structure 
of  our  nervous  system  we  'feel’  'continuity’,  yet  we  can  analyse  it  into  a  smaller 
or  larger  number  of  definite  jumps,  according  to  our  needs.  The  secret  of  this 
process  lies  in  assigning  an  increasing  number  of  jumps,  which  as  they  become 
vanishingly  small,  or  tend  to  zero,  as  we  say,  cease  to  be  felt  as  jumps  and 
are  felt  as  a  ‘continuous’  motion,  or  change,  or  growth  or  anything  of  this  sort. 

An  excellent  example  is  given  by  the  motion  pictures.  When  we  look  at 
them  we  see  a  very  good  representation  of  life  with  all  its  continuity  of 
transitions  between  joy  and  sorrow.  If  we  look  at  an  arrested  film  we  find  a 
definite  number  of  static  pictures,  each  differing  from  the  next  by  a  measurable 
difference  or  jump,  and  the  joy  or  sorrow  which  moved  us  so  in  the  play  of  the 
actors  on  the  moving  film,  becomes  a  static  manifold  of  static  pictures  each 
differing  measurably  from  its  neighbour  by  a  slightly  more  or  less  accentuated 
grimace.  If  we  increase  the  number  of  pictures  in  a  unit  of  'time'  by  using  a 
faster  camera  and  then  release  this  film  at  the  ordinary  speed,  we  get  what  is 
called  slow  motion  pictures  with  which  we  are  all  familiar.  In  them  we  notice 
a  much  greater  smoothness  of  movements  which  in  life  are  jerky,  as,  for  instance, 
the  movements  of  a  running  horse.  They  appear  smooth  and  non-jerky,  the 
horse  looks  as  if  it  were  swimming.  Indeed  we  do  swim  no  less  than  fishes, 
except  that  our  medium;  namely,  air,  is  less  dense  than  water,  and  so  our 
movements  have  to  be  more  energetic  to  overcome  gravitation.  The  above 
example  is  indeed  the  best  analogy  in  existence  of  the  working  of  our  nervous 
system  and  of  the  difference  between  orders  of  abstractions.  Let  us  imagine 
that  some  one  wants  to  study  some  event  as  presented  by  the  moving  picture 
camera.  What  would  he  do?  He  would  first  see  the  picture,  in  its  moving, 
dynamic  form,  and  later  he  would  arrest  the  movement  and  devote  himself 
to  the  contemplation  of  the  static  extensional  manifold,  or  series,  of  the  static 
pictures  of  the  film.  It  should  be  noticed  that  the  differences  between  the 
static  pictures  are  finite,  definite  and  measurable. 

The  power  of  analysis  which  we  humans  possess  in  our  higher  order 
abstractions  is  due  precisely  to  the  fact  that  they  are  static  and  so  we  can  take 
our  ‘time’  to  investigate,  analyse  ,  .  The  lower  order  abstractions,  such  as 
our  lookmg  at  the  moving  picture,  are  shifting  and  non-permanent  and  thus 
evade  any  serious  analysis.  On  the  level  of  looking  at  the  moving  film,  we  get 
a  general  feeling  of  the  events,  with  a  very  imperfect  memory  of  what  we  have 
seen,  coloured  to  a  large  extent  by  our  moods  and  other  ‘emotional’  or  organic 
states.  We  are  on  the  shifting  level  of  lower  order  abstractions,  'feelings’, 
motions  ,  and  'emotions’.  The  first  lower  centres  do  the  best  they  can  in  a 
given  case  but  the  value  of  their  results  is  highly  doubtful,  as  they  are  not 
especially  reliable.  Now  the  higher  order  abstractions  are  produced  by  the 

SEMANTICS  OF  THE  DIFFERENTIAL  CALCULUS  579 

higher  centres,  further  removed,  and  not  in  direct  contact  with  the  world  around 
US.  With  the  finite  velocity  of  nerve  currents  it  takes  ‘time’  for  impulses  to 
reach  these  centres,  as  the  cortical  pathways  offer  higher  neural  resistances 
than  the  other  pathways.8  So  there  has  to  be  a  survival  mechanism  in  the 
production  of  nervous  means  for  arresting  the  stream  of  events  and  producing 
static  pictures  of  permanent  character,  which  may  allow  us  to  investigate, 
verify,  analyse  ,  .  It  must  be  noticed  that  because  of  this  higher  neural  resistance 
of  higher  centres  and  the  static  character  of  the  higher  abstractions,  these 
abstractions  are  less  distorted  by  affective  moods.  For,  since  the  higher  abstrac¬ 
tions  persist,  if  we  care  to  remember  them,  and  the  moods  vary,  we  can  con¬ 
template  the  abstractions  under  different  moods  and  so  come  to  some  average 
outlook  on  a  given  problem.  It  is  true  that  we  seldom  do  this,  but  we  may  do 
it,  and  this  is  of  importance  to  us. 

As  one  of  the  aims  of  the  calculus  is  to  study  relative  rates  of  change 
we  will  consider  a  series  of  successive  values  of  our  variable  which  differ  by 
little  from  each  other.  If  we  have  y=f{x)  we  can  consider  the  change  in  *  for 
a  short  interval,  let  us  say,  from  Xq  to  Xi,  so  that  we  assign  to  our  x  two  values, 
x  =Xq  and  x  =xi.  The  corresponding  values  of  our  function  or  y  will  be  y0  =/(* o) 
and  yi  ~/(x0.  In  general,  small  changes  in  y  will  be  almost  proportional  to  the 
corresponding  changes  in  x ,  provided  f(x)  is  ‘continuous  . 

Denoting  the  smalt  increment  of  x  byAx,  so  that  xi -x0  = Ax  or  xi  =  x0+Ax, 
function  y  receives  the  increment  yi~yo-Ay  or  yi=yo-bAy.  Since  yi=/(xi) 

from  both  sides 

by  Ax  we  have 

(1) 

and  xi==xo+Ax  we  have: 

y0  +A y  =/(x0  +Ax) ;  if  we  subtract 

y0  «/(* o)  we  would  have 

Ay  =/(x0  +  Ax)  -f(x o) ;  dividing  both  sides 
Ay  /(x0+Ax)-/(x0) 

Ax  Ax 

The  above  ratio  represents  the  ratio  of  the  increment  of  the  function  to  the 
increment  of  the  variable.  In  the  limit  when  the  increment  in  the  variable 
becomes  vanishingly  small  or  when  Ax  tends  toward  zero,  and  our  function  is 

continuous,  the  limit  of  this  ratio  gives  us  the  law  of  change  or  growth  of 

our  function.

is  called  the  derivative  of  y  with  respect  to  x  and  is  denoted  by  D*y,  which 
we  read  ‘D*  of  y\  in  symbols,

Let  us  illustrate  this  by  a  simple  numerical  example.  Take  the  equation 
y=x2  and  assume  that  x  =  100,  whence  y  =**  10,000.  Suppose  the  increment  of  x, 
namely,  Ax  *  1/10.  Then  x+Ax  =  100.1  and  (x+Ax)2  =  100.1  X  100.1  =  10020.01. 
The  last  1  is  1  /100  and  only  one  millionth  part  of  the  10,000,  and  so,  we  can 

580  VIII.  ON  THE  STRUCTURE  OF  MATHEMATICS 

neglect  it  and  consider  y  +A y  =  10,020 ;  whence  A y  -  20  and  A y /Ax  -  20 /0. 1  -  200. 
In  the  general  case,  i(  y=x?  and  instead  of  *  we  take  a  slightly  larger  value, 
x+Ax,  then  our  function  y  also  becomes  slightly  larger;  thus, 
y  +Ay  =  (x  +Ax)  2=x2  +2xAx + (A*) 2 
If  we  subtract  y = x2  from  the  last  expression  we  have 

Ay=2xAx+{AxY,  dividing  by  Ax,  we  have 
Ay/ Ax  =  2x  +Ax. 

In  the  limit  as  Ax  approaches  zero,  the  value  of  the  above  ratio,  or  the  rate  of 
change  of  our  function,  would  be  2x,  as  Ax  would  disappear.  If  our  *  =  100,  the 
above  ratio  would  be  200,  as  determined  above  in  the  case  of  the  numerical 
example.  Another  way  of  symbolizing  the  derivative  is  D,y~dy/dx,  but  this 
requires  a  short  explanation. 

In  Chapter  XV  we  have  already  discussed  the  problem  of  the  ‘infinitesimal1 
and  we  have  seen  that  ‘infinitesimal'  is  a  misnomer  and  that  there  is  no  such 
thing  at  all.  Yet  this  word  is  very  often  uncritically  used  by  mathematicians 
and  is  therefore  often  confusing.  By  an  ‘infinitesimal'  mathematicians  mean  a 
varmble  which  approaches  zero  as  a  limit.  The  condition  that  it  should  be  a 
variable  is  essential.  It  would  probably  be  better  to  call  an  ‘infinitesimal’  an 
indefinitely  small  quantity  or  ‘indefinitesimal’,  and  that  is  what  the  reader 
should  understand  when  he  sees  anywhere  the  word  ‘infinitesimal’  or  ‘infinitely 
small  quantity’. 

These  indefinitely  small  quantities  are  in  general  neither  equal,  nor  even 
of  one  order.  Some  by  comparison  are  indefinitely  smaller  than  others,  and 
hence  are  said  to  be  ‘of  higher  order’.  Usually  several  quantities  are  considered 
which  approach  zero  simultaneously.  In  such  a  case  one  of  them  is  chosen  as 
the  principal  indefinitely  small  quantity.  Let  us  recall  that  if  we  take  any 
number,  for  example,  1,  and  divide  it  by  2  we  have  1  /2.  If  we  divide  1  by  4 
we  have  1/4  which  is  smaller  than  1/2  ;  if  we  divide  1  by  10  we  have  1  /10  which 
is  still  smaller.  If  we  carry  this  process  on  indefinitely,  taking  larger  and  larger 
denominators,  the  results  are  fractions  of  smaller  and  smaller  values.  In  the 
limit,  as  the  value  of  the  denominator  becomes  indefinitely  large  the  value 
of  the  fraction  approaches  zero.  This  simple  consideration  will  help  us  in  the 
classification  of  indefinitely  small  quantities. 

Let  us  take  a  as  the  principal  indefinitely  small  quantity  and  b  another 
indefinitely  small  quantity.  If  the  ratio  b/a  approaches  zero  with  a  we  say 
that  b  is  an  indefinitely  small  quantity  of  higher  order  with  respect  to  a.  In 
other  words,  although  a  approaches  zero  in  the  limit  yet  it  is  infinitely  larger 
than  b  and  so  the  ratio  b/a  also  approaches  zero. 

If  the  ratio  b/a  approaches  a  limit  k  different  from  zero  as  a  approaches 
zero,  then  b  is  said  to  be  of  the  ‘same  order'  as  a  and  b/a=k  +  t  where  €  is  in¬ 
definitely  small  with  respect  to  a.  In  such  a  case  b  =a  (£  +  «)  =ka  +acf  and  ka  is 
called  the  principal  part  of  b.  The  term  at  is  obviously  of  a  higher  order  than  a. 

We  may  say  in  general  that  if  we  have  a  power  of  a,  for  instance  a\  such 
that  the  ratio  b/an  approaches  a  limit  different  from  zero,  b  is  called  an 
'infinitesimal'  (indefinitesimal)  of  order  n  with  respect  to  a. 

SEMANTICS  OF  THE  DIFFERENTIAL  CALCULUS  581 

Let  us  give  a  numerical  illustration.  We  know  that  there  are  60  minutes 
in  one  hour,  24  hours  in  a  day,  or  that  there  are  1440  minutes  in  a  day,  and  by 
multiplying  1440  by  7,  that  there  are  10,080  minutes  in  a  week.  Our  forefathers 
called  this  1/10,080  part  of  a  week  a  ‘minute’  because  of  its  minuteness.  It  is 
obvious  that  a  minute  is  very  small  as  compared  with  a  week.  But  if  we  sub¬ 
divide  a  minute  into  60  equal  parts  we  have  a  still  smaller  quantity,  a  quantity 
of  second  order  smallness  and  so  we  called  it  a  second.  Indeed  there  are  3600 
seconds  in  one  hour,  86,400  seconds  in  a  day  and  604,800  seconds  in  a  week. 
If  we  decide  that  for  some  purpose  a  minute  is  as  short  a  period  of  ‘time’  as  we 
need  to  consider,  then  the  second,  1/60  of  a  minute,  is  relatively  so  small  that 
it  could  be  neglected.  In  a  calculation  where  1  / 100  of  some  unit  is  the  smallest 
value  which  needs  to  be  considered,  we  may  define  this  1/100  as  of  first  order 

smallness.  Then  1/100  of  1/100,  or  1/10,000,  of  that  unit,  which  is  relatively 
of  second  order  smallness,  is  entirely  negligible.  The  fractions  whose  smallness 
we  are  considering  here  are  comparatively  large,  and  we  usually  deal  with 
much  smaller  quantities,  but  the  smaller  a  quantity  is,  the  more  negligible 
the  correspondingly  smaller  quantity  of  higher  order  becomes. 

Let  us  consider  a  geometrical  interpretation  of  the  above.  If  we  represent 
a  quantity  X  by  a  line  segment,  and  a  slightly  greater  quantity,  x+dx ,  by  a 
slightly  longer  line  segment ;  then  the  quantities  x2  and  (x  *f  dx)2  =x2 +2xdx  -f  (dx)2 
may  be  represented  by  squares  where  sides  are  the  line  segments  which  represent 

the  quantities  x  and  x+dx  respectively. 

If  we  denote  the  areas  by  A ,  2$,  C,  Df  we  see  that  A-x2  and  that 
A  +B+C+D  *=x2+2xdx+(dx)2.  If  we  select  our  dx  smaller  and  smaller  the 
areas  B  =C—xdx  diminishing  in  one  dimension  only,  become  also  smaller  and 

smaller,  but  D  =  {dx)2  is  vanishing  much  more  rapidly  as  it  is  diminishing  m 
each  of  two  dimensions,  whence  it  is  said  to  be  a  quantity  of  second  order 
smallness,  which  for  all  purposes  at  hand  may  be  neglected.

582  VIII.  ON  THE  STRUCTURE  OF  MATHEMATICS 

In  the  above  expression  Dxy Ax  represents  the  principal  part  and  «A*  appears 
as  an  indefinites, mal  of  higher  order.  This  principal  part  is  called  the  dif¬ 
ferential  of  y  and  is  denoted  by  dy.  If  we  choose  f(x)  -*  we  have  dx  =»A*  and 

so,  ay*=Dxydx . 

So  we  see  that  the  differential  of  the  independent  variable  x  is  equal  to 
the  increment  of  that  variable.  This  statement  is  not  generally  true  about 
the  dependent  variable,  as  t  does  not  generally  vanish. 

The  derivative  is  also  sometimes  denoted  as/(x)  or  y'  and  this  notation 

is  due  to  Lagrange;  all  three  notations  are  used  and  it  is  well  to  be  acquainted 
with  them. 

The  denyatiye  of  a  function /(x)  is  in  general  another  function  of  x,  let 
us  say  /  {x).  If  /  (x)  has  a  derivative,  the  new  function  is  the  derivative  of  the 
derivative  or  the  second  derivative  olf(x)  and  is  denoted  by  y"  or /"(*).  Similarly 
the  third  derivative  y"’  or  f'"(x)  is  defined  as  the  derivative  of  the  second 
derivative  and  so  on.  In  the  other  notations  we  have: 

.  .  dx  \dx  /  dx 2 

Having  introduced  these  few  definitions  it  must  be  emphasized  that  the 
main  importance  of  the  calculus  is  in  its  central  idea;  namely,  the  study  of  a 
continuous  function  by  following  its  history  by  indefinitely  small  steps,  as  the 
function  changes  when  we  give  indefinitely  small  increments  to  the  independent 
variable.  As  was  emphasized  before,  the  whole  psycho-logics  of  this  process  is 
intimately  connected  with  the  activities  of  the  nervous  structure  and  also  with 
the  structure  of  science.  In  this  work  we  are  not  interested  in  calculations, 
comp  1  cations,  or  analytical  niceties.  Mathematicians  have  taken  excellent  care 
of  all  that.  We  need  only  to  know  about  the  structure  and  method  which  help 
to  trans  ate  dynamic  into  static,  and  vice  versa;  to  translate  'continuity'  on 
one  level,  or  order  of  abstraction,  into  ‘steps’  on  another. 

To  illustrate  what  has  been  said  and  to  give  the  reader  the/eel  of  the  process 
let  us  take  for  instance  a  simple  equation  y  =  2x3-x+5  where  y  represents  the 
function  of  the  variable  *  expressed  by  a  group  of  symbols  to  the  right  of  the 
sign  of  equality. 

To  .determme  the  relative  rate  of  growth  of  this  function,  that  is,  to 
lfferentiate  it,  we  replace  x  by  a  slightly  larger  value;  namely,  x+Ax,  and  see 
what  happens  to  the  expression.  2x*  becomes  2(x  +Ax)3  =  2x3  +6x*Ax  +6x(Ax)2 
+2(Ax)3;  —x  becomes  -x-Ax  and  the  constant  5  remains  unchanged.  In 
symbols,  y+Ay  =  2**+6*?Ax+6x(Ax)*+2(.Ax)*-x-Ax+S,  where  Ay  repre¬ 
sents  the  increment  of  the  function  and  Ax  represents  the  increment  of  the 
independent  variable. 

Subtracting  the  original  expression  y  =  2x3-x+S  we  get  the  amount  by 
which  the  function  has  been  increased,  namely: 

Ay  =  6x*Ax+6x(Ax)*+2(Ax)a -Ax. 

To  determine  the  relation,  or  ratio,  of  Ay,  the  increment  of  the  function,  to  Ax 
Oie  increment  of  the  independent  variable  which  produced  Ay,  we  divide 
Ay  by  Axt  and  obtain  the  equation 

SEMANTICS  OF  THE  DIFFERENTIAL  CALCULUS  583 

^-6*>+6*Ax+2(A*)l-l. 

Ax 

Then  as  Ax  approaches  0  the  terms  in  the  right-hand  side  of  the  equation 
which  contain  Ax  as  a  factor  also  approach  0  and  replacing  the  left-hand  side 

by  -  we  obtain  the  equation  -p  -  6**  - 1  which  means,  that  as  Ax  approaches  0, 

J  dx 

the  ratio  of  the  increment  of  the  function  to  the  increment  of  the  independent 
variable  approaches  6x2-l,  true  for  any  value  we  may  arbitrarily  assign  to  *. 

It  should  be  noticed  that  in  our  function  the  left-hand  side  represents 
the  ‘whole*  as  composed  of  interrelated  elements  which  are  represented  by  the 
right-hand  side.  When  instead  of  x  we  selected  a  slightly  larger  value;  namely, 
%+Ax,  we  performed  upon  this  altered  value  all  the  operations  indicated  by 
our  expression.  We  thus  have  in  mathematics,  because  of  the  self-imposed 
limitations,  the  first  and  only  example  of  complete  analysis,  impossible  m 
physical  problems  as  in  these  there  are  always  characteristics  left  out. 

An  important  structural  and  methodological  issue  should  also  be  empha¬ 
sized.  In  the  calculus  we  introduce  a  ‘small  increment'  of  the  variable;  we 
performed  upon  it  certain  indicated  operations,  and  in  the  final  results  this 
arbitrary  increment  disappeared  leaving  important  information  as  to  the 
rate  of  change  of  our  function.  This  device  is  structurally  extremely  useful 
and  can  be  generalized  and  applied  to  language  with  similar  results. 

It  has  been  noticed  already  that  the  calculus  can  be  developed  without  any 
reference  to  graphs,  co-ordinates  or  any  appeal  to  geometrical  notions;  but  as 
geometry  is  an  all-important  link  between  pure  analysis  and  the  outside  world 
of  physics,  we  find  in  geometry  also  the  psycho-logical  link  between  the  higher 
and  lower  orders  of  abstraction.  But  the  appeal  to  geometrical  notions  helps 
intuition  and  so  is  extremely  useful.  For  this  reason  we  will  explain  briefly  a 
system  of  co-ordinates  and  show  what  geometrical  significance  the  derivative  has 

We  take  in  a  plane  two  straight  lines  X'X  and  Y'  Y,  intersecting  at  0  at 
right  angles,  so  that  X'OX  is  horizontal  extending  to  the  left  and  right  of  0, 
and  YOY ',  is  vertical,  extending  above 

and  below  0,  as  a  frame  of  reference 
for  the  locations  of  point,  lines,  and 
other  geometrical  figures  in  the  plane. 
We  call  this  a  two-dimensional  rec¬ 
tangular  system  of  co-ordinates.  This 
method  may  be  extended  to  three  di¬ 
mensions,  and  our  points,  lines,  and 
other  geometrical  figures  referred  to  a 
three-dimensional  rectangular  system  of 

co-ordinates  consisting  of  three  mutually 

Fig.  2 

perpendicular  and  intersecting  planes. 

As  we  see  in  Fig.  2,  we  have  four  quadrants  I,  II,  HI,  IV,  formed  by  the 
intersecting  axes  X'X  and  Y'Y.  The  co-ordinates  of  a  point  P,  by  which  we 

584  VIII.  ON  THE  STRUCTURE  OF  MATHEMATICS 

mean  the  distances  from  the  axes  determine  the  position  of  the  point  uniquely. 
We  call  X'X  and  Y'Y  the  axis  of  X  and  the  axis  of  Y  respectively,  and  0  the 
origin.  If  we  select  a  point  Pi  in  the  plane  of  X'X  and  Y*  Y  and  draw  it  line 
P\M  perpendicular  to  X'X  then  OM  and  MP\  are  called  the  co-ordinates 
of  Pi;  OM  is  called  the  abscissa  and  is  denoted  by  x=b;  and  MPi  is  called  the 
ordinate  and  denoted  by  y  =a.  We  speak  of  Pi  as  the  point  (b,a),  or,  in  general, 
of  any  point  as  the  point  (x,y). 

Let  us  draw  ON  =  0M =b  and  draw  lines  PXP4  and  P2P3  through  M  and  N 
respectively  perpendicular  to  X'X,  making  MP4  =*NP2  =NPZ  =MPi  We 
then  have  four  points  Pi,  P2,  Pj,  P4»  in  each  one  of  the  four  quadrants  and 
all  of  them  by  construction  would  have  equal  numerical  values  for  their 
abscissas  and  ordinates.  To  be  able  to  discriminate  between  the  four  quadrants, 
and  so  avoid  ambiguity,  we  make  the  convention  that  all  values  of  y  above 
X'X  are  to  be  positive  and  below  X'X  negative;  and  all  values  of  x  to  the  right 
of  Y'Y  positive,  to  the  left  negative.  Thus  we  see  that  by  such  conventions 
the  point  Pi  would  have  both  b  and  a  positive;  P2  would  have  b  negative  and 
a  positive;  P3  both  b  and  a  negative,  and  finally  P4  would  have  b  positive  and 
a  negative,  or  in  symbols  Pi(b,a);  P2(~b,a);  £*(-&,  -a);  and  finally  P4(b,  -a). 

It  is  obvious  that  for  any  point  on  the  X  axis  (for  instance  M)  the  ordinate 
y=0.  If  our  point  is  on  the  Y  axis  the  abscissa  x-0  and  the  co-ordinates  of 
the  origin  0  are  both  zero  (0,0). 

From  the  above  definitions  we  see  at  once  how  to  plot,  or  locate,  a  point. 
To  plot  the  point  (—4,3),  since  the  abscissa  x  is  negative  and  the  ordinate  y  is 
positive  we  locate  N  on  X'X,  4  units  to  the  left  of  O.  At  N  we  erect  a  perpen¬ 
dicular  upon  which  we  locate  the  point  (-4,3),  3  units  above  N.  The  symbol 
( -4,3)  represents  a  particular  case  of  the  general  symbol  (x,y)  and  is  accordingly 
plotted  as  a  particular  point  as  just  shown.  If  instead  of  the  pair  or  relations 
expressed  by  two  equations  x  —  —4,  y  =3,  we  have  a  single  relation  expressed 
by  one  equation,  for  example,  y  =x~2,  we  have  y  expressed  as  a  function  of  x, 
whence  by  assigning  to  x  different  values,  corresponding  values  of  y  are 
determined,  and  a  set  of  points  may  be  plotted  where  abscissas  and  ordinates 
are  corresponding  values  of  x  and  y  respectively.  Thus,  when  x=X),  y=  -2, 
when  *  =  1,  y=  -1,  when  x  =  2,  y  =0,  when  x  =  3,  y  =  l,  when  x=4,  y  =  2  ,  . 

We  may  now  plot  the  points  A(0, -2);  B(l, -1);  C(2, 0);  £>(3,1);  £(4,2); 
or  as  many  more  points  as  we  may  choose  by  giving  x  additional  different 

values. 

If  we  give  to  x  successive  values  with  smaller 
differences  our  points  would  be  closer  together, 
for  instance  for 

*=0  y  =  —2  (A) 

*=0.5  y=  —1.5  (A’) 

*  =  1  y=  — 1  (5) 

*  =  1.5  y=  —0.5  ( J3 ') 

*  =  2  y  =  0  (C)

SEMANTICS  OF  THE  DIFFERENTIAL  CALCULUS  585 

As  we  plot  larger  and  larger  numbers  of  points  closer  and  closer  together,  in 
the  limit,  if  we  take  indefinitely  many  such  points,  we  approach  a  smooth  line. 
It  can  be  proved  that  an  equation  of  the  type  given  in  this  example;  namely, 
where  both  variables  are  of  the  first  order,  always  represents  a  straight  line. 
Such  equations  are  called  therefore  Unear  equations,  as  they  represent  straight 
lines. 

The  problem  of  linearity  and  non-linearity  is  of  extreme  importance,  and 
we  will  return  to  it  later  on.  Here  we  are  interested  only  in  the  definition  and 
meaning  of  linearity  of  equations. 

x 2 

Let  us  consider  next  a  simple  equation  of  second  degree,  y  - y.  In  assign¬ 
ing  arbitrary  values  to  we  note  that  x2  is  always  positive  (by  the  rule  of 
signs)  whether  x  is  positive  or  negative.  Hence,  we  may  tabulate  values  of  x 
*vith  the  double  sign  ±  meaning  either  +  or  —  .

We  see  for  each  value  of  y  we  have  two  values  for  x  which  differ  only  in  sign 
This  means  that  we  have  points  on  two  sides  of  the  V  axis  with  numerically 

equal  abscissas  and,  since  for  #  =0,  y  -0, 
the  beginning  of  our  curve  is  at  the  origin 
of  co-ordinates  and  the  curve  is  symmet¬ 
rical  with  respect  to  the  Y  axis. 

If  we  connect  the  points  D\  C',  B\ 
A',  0t  A,  B ,  C,  Dt  with  straight  lines  we 
have  a  broken  line.  But  if  we  choose  smaller 
and  smaller  differences  between  the  suc¬ 
cessive  values  of  x,  the  broken  line  be¬ 
comes  smoother  and  smoother,  and,  in 
the  limit,  as  we  take  increasingly  smaller 
steps,  or,  in  other  words,  plot  indefinitely 
larger  numbers  of  points  in  one  interval,  we 
approach  a  smooth,  or  continuous  curve.

It  must  be  noticed  that  in  equations 
of  higher  orders  the  ratio  of  changes  in 
the  function  y  to  corresponding  changes  in  the 
point,  and  so  we  have  a  curve  instead  of  a  straight  line, 
come  quite  clear  on  this  point  so  we  may  better  compare 
of  equations  as  to  the  law  of  their  growth. 

586  VIII.  ON  THE  STRUCTURE  OF  MATHEMATICS 

Let  us  write  down  in  two  columns  the  successive  values  for  the  two  types 
of  equations.  Let  us  take  the  equation  y-~  with  the  graph  shown  in  the 

preceding  diagram  (Fig.  4)  and  the  equation  y=2x  as  shown  in  Fig.  5.

Fig.  5 

The  equation  y  =  2x  involves  the  variables  in  the  first  degree  and  we  see  that 
the  ratio  of  changes  in  the  ordinates  to  corresponding  changes  in  the  abscissas 
remains  constant  (proportional).  The  triangles  in  Fig.  5,  are  either  equal  or 
similar,  which  necessitates  the  equality  of  angles  and  so  the  line  OABCD  is 
of  necessity  a  straight  line.  In  this  case  as  *=0  gave  us  y- 0  the  line  passes 
through  the  origin  of  co-ordinates. 

The  picture  is  entirely  different  in  the  case  of  the  higher  degree  equation,
